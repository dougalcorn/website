h1. About Me

My name is Doug Alcorn. I'm a 30-something husband, dad, Christian,
and hacker living in Cincinnai, OH., USA. When I'm not on my computer
or being a dad, I'm usually shooting photos or out in the woods.

I've been doing professional software development since I graduated
college in 1993.  Most of my career has been writing embedded SQL
using C on one Unix platform or another.  Thankfully, those days are
over.  I'm a straight up web developer now.  I've done a lot of web
applications in Perl and even one in C++.  Since early 2005 I've done
all my web development in Ruby on Rails.  As such, I'm "available for
hire":/pages/ruby-on-rails-developer.
