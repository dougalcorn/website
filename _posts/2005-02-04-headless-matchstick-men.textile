No one can argue that high-speed ballistic photography is cool.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spyzter/sets/82850/" target="_top">Here's</a> a set of photos posted by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spyzter/" target="_top">spyzter</a> to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_top">Flickr</a>.

By the way, I posted this blog entry using Flickr's "blog this" utility and the <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><font color="#0000FF">MetaBlogger</font></span><a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/edit/Main/MetaBlogger?topicparent=Main.WebHome">?</a> API.  Unfortunately, I had to do a lot of hand-tweaking in Ecto.  However, it did simplify setting up the image and getting all the URLs correct.  Also, I was unable to set the category from the Flickr interface.  Nor was I able to change the category in Ecto.  I suspect that might be a bug in the old version of blosxom-xmlrpc.cgi I'm using.
