I saw <a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:285899" target="_top">Elf</a> tonight.  What a wonderful movie!  It's about as perfect a movie as I've seen in a long time.  What I mean by "perfect" is that it has a well developed purpose and fulfills it perfectly.  It's light, funny, and entertaining.  <a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=2:224449" target="_top">Will Ferrell</a> is absolutely hilarious.  I don't know if anyone else could have pulled this role off.  In fact, this film would be quite flat without him.  The story is a classic one of grumpy people with a change of heart with Christmas cheer.  In the end, everything works out right.  While it's rated PG, the humor is mostly adult humor.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing offensive or crude.  It's just more subtle than any of my kids could pick up on.  This is one I'll probably own.  Who knows, it could become a Christmas classic.
