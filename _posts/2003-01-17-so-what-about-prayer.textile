Again, pointing to an article on "Daily Devotions with Barry Davis".  This one is titled <a href="http://dailydevotions.injesus.com/Groups/ViewMessage.cfm?MessageId=8A007CXD&amp;GroupID=3A006RXH&amp;CFID=1978269&amp;CFTOKEN=82497167&amp;UCD=92d" target="_top">Authentic Prayer</a>.  It's actually from a few days ago.  I didn't write about it right away because I needed some time to stew on it a bit.  The article highlights this passage:
<p />
<blockquote>
Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you
may be healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great
power and wonderful results. Elijah was as human as we are, and yet
when he prayed earnestly that no rain would fall, none fell for the
next three and a half years! Then he prayed for rain, and down it
poured. The grass turned green, and the crops began to grow
again. -- James 5:16-18 (NLT)
</blockquote>
<p />
My life experiences make this hard to believe.  I'm more comfortable with, "Lord I believe.  Help my unbelief!".

I don't know how many people read this web log.  However, I am deeply interested in what you believe about prayer.  If you're reading this, please email me your thoughts on prayer, what it's good for, how often you pray, what prompts you to pray, and examples of the differences it's made.
