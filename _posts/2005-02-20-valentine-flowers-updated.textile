Today I noticed that one of the whatever they're called had opened up.  Upon Carla's suggestion, I shot a couple photographs of <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/02-February/Valentine%20Flowers/" target="_top">Valentine Flowers</a>.  I only got two good ones.  I went ahead and used my tripod and remote.  Actually, this is the first time I've felt the need to go into full manual mode.  I even did manual focus.

All droopy like this it's kind of sad.  When I saw it I thought, "Ah, too bad.  Valentine's Day is past..."
<p />
So here I am all excited about my flower photos and posted them to <a href="http://planet.photogeeks.org" target="_top">#photography</a> looking for some praise and critique.  I got a nice comment on how sharp the second shot was a the center.  The other observation was that the colors seemed a little flat.  Here's two links on photographing flowers close up that was suggested: <a href="http://www.photos-of-the-year.com/flowers/" target="_top">How To Photograph Flowers</a> and <a href="http://www.sederquist.com/claflowr.html" target="_top">Flower and Close-up Photography</a>.  I'm still pretty happy with my photos, but those articles are good reading.  Maybe I'll reshoot... <img alt="smile" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/smile.gif" />

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've reworked the photos in Photoshop.  I think these versions are definitely better than the previous two.  I really felt like I had a good image in the camera, I just had to work a little harder to get it out.

I also went ahead and <a href="http://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/186487" target="_top">posted</a> the droopy flower to the "Nature &#38; Wildlife" forum on <a href="http://fredmiranda.com" target="_top">http://fredmiranda.com</a>.
