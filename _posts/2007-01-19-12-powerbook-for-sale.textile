I'm "selling":http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=190074184592&ssPageName=STRK:MESE:IT&ih=009 my 12" Powerbook on eBay.  It has a 1GHz G4 w/768MB RAM, 40GB Hard Disk, and a combo drive.  It also has built in bluetooth and an airport extreme.  I just got the battery replaced through the recall, so it's brand new with plenty of life.  All that's installed on it is Mac OS X 10.4.8 Tiger and iLife '04.  Bid early, bid often!
