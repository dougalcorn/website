Every Sunday morning my family gets up and goes to church.  It's important for me to take time out to worship God and it's important to hang out with other Christians.  Some Sundays I wake up refreshed and excited.  The kids are happy and quickly get dressed and ready to go.  We're all loaded into the car with plenty of time to make it without rushing and without being late.  The kids go to class happily and are glad to see their friends.  During service they behave and cause little disruption.  I, myself, am able to pay attention.  I learn from the sermon.  I feel emotional satisfaction from my period of worship.  I see friends and share parts of my week.  I'm able to encourage others.  Others encrouage me.

This Sunday wasn't like that.
