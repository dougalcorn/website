I received a review of Mel Gibson's "The Passion" by email today.  It's a well written review.  So much, that I considered posting the text of the review here.  Instead I did some googling and found the original post of it on the web.  Keith A Fournier wrote <a href="http://www.christianity.com/partner/Article_Display_Page/0,,PTID5339%7CCHID14%7CCIID1615818,00.html" target="_top">this review</a> on <a href="http://www.christianity.com" target="_top">http://www.christianity.com</a>.

I'm sad I feel I need this disclaimer though.  I'm not Catholic.  There are a lot of things about Catholicism I don't like.  If you feel the same way, just put all that aside and enjoy the review of this movie.
