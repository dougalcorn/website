title: TWiki Is Down

Since I think June of 2002 I've run my main website on a "TWiki":http://twiki.org/.  I used to write lots of articles and stuff there kinda like a blog.  I had hoped that friends and family would use the wiki editing fuctions to build the site out.  As it turns out, I was pretty much the only author.  

Over time I've become tired of maintaining it.  This blog is run by typo.  You can probably see I haven't been updating it very well either.  My TWiki has had lots of problems with vandalism and security.  So, I've finally taken it down.

I've migrated my most popular content over to typo as "pages":/pages/index.html.  I added a bunch of rewrite rules to my apache config.  Hopefully this won't affect my google-fu too much.  I'll have to watch the 404s for awhile to see if there's anything I've missed.

Anyway, so long twiki and thanks for all the fish!
