Part of my justification for my <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><font color="#0000FF">CanonDigitalRebel</font></span><a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/edit/Main/CanonDigitalRebel?topicparent=Main.WebHome">?</a> and the lenses I bought was the killer rebates from Canon.  Basically, it's like double or triple coupon day.  You buy one item on their list you get the standard rebate.  You buy two items on their list you double the standard rebate on each item!  Buy three and you triple the rebate on all three items.

I had heard that <a href="http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Canon-Lenses/Canon-Lens-Rebates.aspx" target="_top">Canon was very picky</a> and more than a little bit of trouble to get the rebates.  So, I thought I was fairly meticulous about filling out the form and including everything I needed.  Turns out I had my rebate partially rejected.  I didn't include the cut-out of the logo from my lens box.  They mailed me the rebate minus the calculation for the lens and a resubmission card.  I was able to resubmit the card and the cut-out of the lens box to get the remainder of my rebate.  I finally mailed that today.  We'll see how long it takes for processing.
