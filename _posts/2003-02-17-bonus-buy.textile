Saturday we went shopping for all our painting stuff.  Prior to that we went to our local K-Mart's store closing sale.  By the time we got to Lowe's it was almost 3:00 in the afternoon; definitely nap time for both Tiffany and Justin.  Needless to say it was an adventure.  There must have been 50 people in line ot get paint mixed (an obvious exaduration).  To help settle things down, Just and I went "off".  He was nearly asleep, so I was carrying him while looking at all the fun guy things at Lowe's.  Ended up in the tool-box section.  I've got an old metal Craftsman tool-box that was given to me before I started High School.  It's very simple: the lid opens up to reveal a top tray and a large area below.  Over the years it's become pretty rust and highly dis-organized.  Of course, what I want is one of those great, big tool-chests on rollers with lots of drawers to organize all my sockets and such.  There's one at Costco that has a hanging file drawer.  That's really cool because I could keep my car shop guides organized with all my parts receipts.  Anyway, I'm getting off track...

I found this one tool-box that I liked.  It was only $10 (the part I liked best).  It was plastic with little screw boxes built into the lid.  Inside it had the standard tray and open area below.  This particular tool-box came with a "bonus buy" of a tiny tool-box inside the other; "two for the price of one."  By now, I had gotten tired of holding Justin and he had gotten tired of being held.  He was down crawling all over the stuff and inside the big shelving units that Lowe's uses to show their wares.  Of course, when I opened a tool-box so did he.  This particular one with the "bonus buy" had a sticker on the inside tool-box that said the same.  When I looked up to check on Justin, he had removed that sticker from the little tool-box inside and was wearing it just like the big stickers he gets at the Doctor's office.  It was very cute to see the "Bonus Buy" sticker on him. <img alt="smile" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/smile.gif" />  Unfortunately it wouldn't stick very well on his shirt and he gave up trying.
