Here's an interesting concept: give users a flat monthly fee to download as much music as they want from a wide variety of artist with no DRM.  Thanks to what appears to be sane Spanish Copyright Law, Pretunes is doing just that.  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/" target="_top">The Register</a> is <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30884.html" target="_top">reporting</a> on the paln.  The interesting thing is there was no link to Puretune's site in their article.  I did some googling and found <a href="http://www.zeropaid.com/news/articles/auto/05192003m.php" target="_top">this article</a> at <a href="http://www.zeropaid.com/" target="_top">Zeropaid.com</a> says the service was shut down because of "overwhelming consumer response".  Are you listening <a href="http://www.boycott-riaa.com/" target="_top">RIAA</a>?  Consumers are willing to pay money for MP3s at reasonable terms.
