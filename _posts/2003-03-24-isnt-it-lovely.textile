I spent almost three hours today cleaning my office.  I had about three weeks of receipts; two or three months of bills andstatements; and untold miscelaneous mail; months and months of computer backups burned onto CD; various USB cables necessary for the kernel development I'm doing; plus all the stuff that Carla thinks I'm supposed to "handle" piled all over my desk and floor.  It was getting so that I almost couldn't see the desk surface.  After putting up with this for two weeks of working from home I couldn't take it any longer.
<p />
Now there's almost nothing on my desk!  I even went through the files in my desk and ripped out the old stuff from 1999, 2000, and 2001.  I'm feeling so organized!
