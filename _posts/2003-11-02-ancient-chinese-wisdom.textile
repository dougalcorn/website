More often than not we eat Sunday lunch at our local Chinese buffet.  The kids actually enjoy it and the food is quite good.  They all love the fortune cookies.  Well, Josh likes getting the fortune.  He doesn't really like the cookie part.  None of my kids read very well.  Josh is learning though.  They'd open their cookies and hand their fortunes to me to read.  I used to just make stuff up; stuff I wanted them to be doing.  I'd say things like "Do what your mother says" or "Talk nice to adults".  Josh started catching on to my game.  So, Carla's been actually reading his.  Today Justin opens his fortune cookie and gets his fortune.  He looks intently at it and says, "No screaming brother".  Priceless.

While I'm talking about lunch at the Chinese place, Josh had chicken-wings for the first time today.  He really liked them.  Besides the usual course of vegetables and chicken he had two of the wings.  He was still hungry (of course) and asked for more.  Carla asked him if he wanted one or two more.  He gets that far off look as he ponders the question then responds with "ten".  In the end, he ate three more.
