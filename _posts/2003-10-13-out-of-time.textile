Carla and I went to see <a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:280231" target="_top">Out of Time</a> with <a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=2:74843" target="_top">Denzel Washington</a>.  A fairly unremarkable picture.  It was good.  There wasn't anything blatantly bad about it.  There were no performances that were notably bad.  The directing was OK.  I think the story was just a little weak.  It was somewhat predictable.

Here's the funny part though.  The most remarkable thing about the film was the guy sitting in front of us.  We went to see the late film that started at 9:40pm.  This guy comes in with is buddy.  They appear to be fairly young (well younger than me).  They sit with the respectable seat between them.  This one guy proceeds to fall asleep almost immediately.  This wasn't a stadium seating theater.  The seats only came up to his mid-shoulders.  His heat kept falling back so he was looking straight up.  The result was extremely loud snoring.  Every so often he would start to choke, snort, and wake up only to quickly fall back asleep.  The whole thing was some strange mixture of annoying and funny.  The guy's poor friend kept poking him trying to keep him up.  I'm sure the friend was quite embarassed.  Anyway, I don't think I've seen anyone snoring in a movie theater.
