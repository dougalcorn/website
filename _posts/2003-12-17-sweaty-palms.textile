Either I'm perpetually nervous when I'm at my computer or something is up.  I've noticed that my palms are very sweaty lately. <img alt="frown" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/frown.gif" />  I shouldn't say "palms" although they are both sweaty.  Really just "palm" though.  My right palm seems to be more sweaty than my left.  I've noticed lately that several times a day I have to wipe sweat off my palm rest.  Usually, it's just the right side that is actually wet.  So what is it about my right side that's different than the left?  My second hard drive for my <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/ThinkPad">ThinkPad</a> is located precisely under my right palm rest.  I think it's just warm enough to heat up my hand without actually feeling unusually warm.  Feel free to file this under "Too Much Information" if you like.  It just occurred to me that the hard drive was there and maybe that's why my right hand is so sweaty.
