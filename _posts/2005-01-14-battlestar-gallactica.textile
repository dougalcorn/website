I'm pretty excited about the new <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/" target="_top">Battlestar Gallactica</a> series starting on the <a href="http://scifi.com/" target="_top">SciFi</a> channel.  It's not that I was a huge BG fan as a kid.  In fact, I didn't ever watch it that I remember.  However, I saw the pilot/movie/mini-series thing a while back when it premiered on SciFi and again recently on NBC.  The pilot movie was good but not phenomenal.  However, I'm really looking for a good new show to watch.  Right now my list is very short: "Judging Amy", "Joan of Arcadia", and "Law &#38; Order".
