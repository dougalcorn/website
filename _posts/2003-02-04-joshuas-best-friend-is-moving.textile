Joshua is five years old.  Yesterday he learned his best friend, Jack Lowry, is moving to Colorado.  Of course, I've known since Thanksgiving.  Jack's parents, Chris and Jaimie, are good friends of Carla and I; probably our best friends here in Cincinnati.  The move makes all of us sad, but no one as much as Josh.  The two of them have been very good friends for the last three years.  Nothing is a big a treat for Josh as going over to Jack's house.  He's never had to deal with anything like this before.  It actually took him several minutes to understand what Jack was telling him.  You could watch the horror grow in him as he was piecing it together.  Overall I'd say he's handling it pretty well.  Of course, he cried for quite a long time.  After a while, Carla had him call Jack up on the phone and they talked about Colorado and what it is like.  Josh had lots of questions for Carla and I too.  Most of them revolved around, "Why does Jack have to move to Colorado?"  He's either a bit too old or a bit too young to really unerstand.  He's just learning about money.  He can't really grasp where it comes from or what a "job" is or why someone would move because of one.  On the other hand, if he were a couple of years younger the whole thing wouldn't phase him at all.  Experience is a harsh task master.  As a parent, it makes me sad to see him sad.
