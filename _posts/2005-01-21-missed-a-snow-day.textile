Forecasters predicted less than 1/2" of snow yesterday.  Last night I measured about 7 1/2" in the middle of my back yard.  I really wanted to take today off and play in the snow with the kids.  My parents are in town from South Carolina.  It's Friday.  It's just a good day to have off.  Oh well.  The snow stopped last night around midnight and things cleared up pretty well.  Everyone's in to work today.  It would have been bad for me to skip today.

I took this photo at about 10:30pm of our neighbor's back yard.  Their back yard looks a lot nicer than ours.  I have no idea how much money they've spent on it though.  I should say that Carla gets quite annoyed with these same Christmas lights.  Our neighbors put them up on November 1, don't take them down until March 31, and turn them on every night.  She gets more than a little tired of it.
