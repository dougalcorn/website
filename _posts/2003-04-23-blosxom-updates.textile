I noticed the "Ask Jeeves" spider loading blosxom pages for really weird dates.  I figured that's because of the mini-month calendar links.  I hadn't trapped for "bad" input.  I really only planned for humans.  So, I've updated the script not to generate links to months in the future and months before when I started blogging.
