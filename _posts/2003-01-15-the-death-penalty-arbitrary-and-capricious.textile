Regardless of your opinion of capital punishment, you should read outgoing Illinois Gov. George Ryan's <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/01/14/ryan/index.html" target="_top">speach</a> defending his commuting the sentences of 157 death row inmates.  Personally, I believe the government has the right to excersize the death penalty.  However, if what Ryan says is true then we need to seriously look at how we go about doing it.
