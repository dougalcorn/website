The boys have "discovered" playing cards.  They mostly play GameCube or GameBoy.  We have some other kids games like "Candy Land" and some others.  I think Justin's favorite game is a board version of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles".  Anyway, I don't know how it got started; but the boys have started playing "Go Fish".  I think it appeals to them on several levels.  First, the cards look like adult games.  Carla and I play cards as often as we can with friends and family.  So playing cards makes them feel part of the adult world.  Also, setup and cleanup is easier than with board games.  What's interesting is that both boys, Josh and Justin, are enjoying playing cards.  It's a game they can both equally enjoy playing together.  Sometimes Josh gets bored with the "baby games".

So, I've only played "Go Fish" with them once.  I need to make time to play more with them.  I try to spend good portions of the weekend with them, but have to work too much during the week.  I've got an iron warming in the fire that may change all that; but I can't say much about it.
