<a href="http://sam.holden.id.au/" target="_top">Sam Holden</a> has published a very nice <a href="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/964/" target="_top">analysis of some popular spam filters</a>.  As regular readers know, I have a large spam problem (it looks like over the last month I've <a href="http://www.lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/JunkCounter" target="_top">averaged over a hundered spam messages a day</a>).  I tried Spam-Assasin for a while.  Honestly, I didn't keep up with the rules.  His results basically show that using bogofilter is the best option as long as you train it well.  I have been using bogofilter since January.  My experience has been that it originally worked very well (as well as Spam-Assassin had worked for me), slightly improved as I trained it, then the false negatives increased significantly.  I think I may write a script to retrain bogofilter every month with the previous month's (or previous two month's) worth of mail.  My problem has been that I get a lot of mail with viruses attached.  I think these binary attachments poison the bogofilter database.  It should be pointed out that Sam's analysis didn't include POPFile, iFile, spambayes, or dspam.  He says he's written a good framework for re-running the tests.  Maybe he'll publish those scripts so we can all evaluate the various filters on our own mail content.
