I rented and watched "Vanilla Sky" <a href="http://www.lathi.net/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/Movies/2003/3/18#VanillaSky" target="_top">again</a>.  I was looking for a movie at Blockbuster and couldn't find anything I thought would be very good.  Since we have a "one free rental each week, use it or loose it" coupon with Blockbuster I felt like I <em>had</em> to rent something.  Turns out Carla had already seen it.  I was hoping it would be the first time for her and she could appreciate the complexity of it all.  As it was, she didn't really care for the film ("too weird") and read her email while watching the film.  At one point in the film she did say regarding Penelope Cruz, "she's just perfect".  I was too scared of incuring some sort of wrath for admiring another woman to ask what she meant.  I can only assume she was referring to Cruz's stunny beauty.
