title: How to trash a CompactFlash

While I'm talking about CompactFlash, I used to have two SanDisk Ultra II 512MB cards.  If you're curious about how to trash a CompactFlash card, give it a dip in a river for about 5 seconds.  For good measure, do it a second time.  I had heard CF cards were pretty tough and could really take a beating.  Apparently that doesn't include swimming in a river.  Even after the card completely dried out, it's a no go.

On the plus side, I ordered a SanDisk Ultra II 1GB card.  Pretty much every time I go out to shoot I fill up at least one 512MB card.  I figure with the 1G card I won't have to worry with swapping cards.  Who knows? Maybe I'll start filling my 1G card when I go out now. <img alt="wink" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/wink.gif" />
