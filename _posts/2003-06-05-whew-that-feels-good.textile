I've had an annoying bug in my website for a long time in IE.  I finally got around to fixing it.  I (obviously) don't browse my site much with IE so it wasn't that big a deal to me.  But when I did, it really annoyed me.  The problem is in how elements inherit attributes.  I have a &lt;div align="center"&gt; tag for most of the main content area.  That's to get the white area centered on the page.  Pretty much the only thing in that div tag is a table for getting the layout of the corners to work right.  In Moz, the table itself doesn't inherit the align="centet"; in IE it does.  So, the upper left corner image was getting centered in it's table cell rather than left aligning.  This actually caused the whole table to be centered with ugly effects.  The corner image showed up as a square corner on the white area with a notch cut out of it.  Well, now that I'm using <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/office/" target="_top">Crossover Office</a> from <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/home/" target="_top">Code Weavers</a> to run IE, I can test my changes pretty easily and get the problem fixed.  It actually took me longer to write this blog entry than it did to fix the bug.  I just had to be sufficiently motivated to fix it and have the right tools.  Now I feel so much better when I see my home page on IE.
