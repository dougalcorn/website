Amidst all this clamor over the middle-east, I don't hear hardly any discussion about our National Energy Policy (or lack there of).  I'd like to see us set some goals.  Here's one: only have 10% of our national energy come from foreign oil in 10 years.  Why isn't there more discussion about realistic alternative fuels?  Is oil/coal <em>really</em> the only solution?

Go ahead and watch the mercedes add to get the free one-day premium pass to read the rest of this cartoon.  Yea, it's hyperbole in a cartoon.  It's still funny though.
