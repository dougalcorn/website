So I actually talked to Amanda in the Pro Gallery team about their C4P(Click for Prints) program.  I was blissfully happy with my implementation but had a couple questions.  As it turns out, they have good reason for discouraging people from using it.

First, there's no way to specify the cropping.  My camera takes pictures with 2x3 aspect ratio.  That means 8x10" photos print perfectly, but 4x6" and 5x7" require cropping.  That means all non 2x3 pictures go through some type of auto-cropping.  Second, all pictures go through Shutterfly's proprietary image correction for color, contrast, exposure, sharpening, etc.  You can turn this off if you like to manage your own color.  The C4P doesn't allow you to turn it off though.  So that's why _I_ don't like the C4P interface.

As it turns out, the C4P interface lives entirely outside Shutterfly's internal tracking system.  Prints come in and work their way through their system; but there's no way to track them during or after the order is completed.  So, they aren't accepting any new accounts.  For my implementation, I used the account setup for the php "Gallery":http://gallery.menalto.com/.  So, it works; but only sort of.

The good news is that Shutterfly fully recognizes the market for photographers who want to host their own galleries but use someone else for back-end fulfillment.  They are working on a complete solution that includes full control of how the prints are done and allowing for custom pricing.  Amanda said it would be ready sometime in 2006.  My guess is this service won't be cheap.  Their current Pro accounts are several hundred dollars a year.  Not very nice for us amateurs.
