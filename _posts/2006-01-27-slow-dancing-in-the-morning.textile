One of my goals has been to get up earlier.  I typically work fairly late into the evening; 12:00am  - 12:30am is pretty typical.  As I've gotten older, I've found I need a certain number of hours to function well.  So, there's something of a disconnect between me getting up in the morning and me working late in the night.

Anyway, nobody really wakes up early and easily in the morning.  Sadly, it's our eight-year-old, Josh who has to get up the earliest.  So I've been getting up with him in the morning and spending some quiet time with him before everyone else gets up.

This morning he was making toast while I was making coffee.  My coffee maker is right next to the toaster.  It struck me how funny we must have looked to an outside observer.  Both of us were kinda shuffling around, each of us taking turns using the same bit of counter space.  It struck me as a comical, _clumsy_, slow dance of the morning.
