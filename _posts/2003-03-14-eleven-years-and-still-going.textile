Today's Carla and my anniversary.  Eleven years ago we were two kids who couldn't get enough of each other.  Carla was recently out of school and I still had two more years.  Maybe we should have waited.  Others told us to wait.  They said we were too young.  They said we should finish school.  I can freely admit the early years were pretty hard.  When I look back my thoughs are that we should have married sooner.  Our life has been up and down across the eleven years.  But all in all, it's never been better.  As the years go by, it get's better and better.

To any young guys who may read this (although I seriously doubt there are any) my advice is this: find a girl that really intrigues you, a girl you can have fun with, and a girl that really digs you.  Find that girl and hang on to her for the rest of your life.  It's not going to be easy, but the value is indescribable.
