They're bringing in a real auctioneer to sell the cakes back to the boys.  It sounds like a scam, but they boys will have fun with it.  Of course waiting until the last minute, Josh and I just finished the cake.  Did I mention this was a Dad and Son cake bake?  We were allowed to have expert help from Carla.  She actually made the cake with Josh's help.  I got to do the decorating part.  Josh did most of it.  He really enjoyed it.  I think Carla helped with the decorating too.  That makes it sound like I didn't do anything really.  But I did.  I helped decorate.  Really.
