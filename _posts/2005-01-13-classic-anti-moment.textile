I catch the bus to work from a park and ride near my house.  This morning was one of those classic anti-moments.  I'm nearly late for the bus and walking across the parking lot.  Somebody else is late and comes whipping through the lot in their mini-van.  Splash! they hit a pot hole and cover my pants in nice brown water.
<p />
I mention this because I just got back from my weekly lunch "with the guys".  I had forgotten my umbrella and had to walk back just over three blocks in the rain.  These pants are definitely due a trip to the cleaners. <img alt="whatever" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/indifferent.gif" />
