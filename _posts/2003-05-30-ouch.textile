<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk" target="_top">The Register</a> really <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30954.html" target="_top">slams blogging</a>.  I guess they are a two edged sword.  I really appreciate their wit when they choose to use it to illuminate the absurd or just plain silly things in the IT world.  I don't really appreciate it when they call me a middle-aged psychopath or one of the "adolescents of all ages".  I guess blogging does make me a bit of an exhibitionish.  Personally, though, blogging is just a way for me to capture my thoughts on things as they pass me by.  Admittedly captuting those things in a public forum is exhibitionist.  Does that make me adolescent?

The biggest legitimate use of blogs is in reporting family events and stories.  I honestly believe we as a society suffer from "disconnectedness".  Part of it is how often we are required to move with our jobs and how geographically dispersed we are from our extended family.  Maybe it's not the whole society; maybe it's just me and the friends I've had to leave behind.  I see blogging as a valid way to share with geographically dispersed friends and family the day to day happenings of our lives.  Sharing those things is part of what helps make good friends good friends.

I hope you don't find this blog foolish or adolescent.  I hope you find it informative and more than a little entertaining.
