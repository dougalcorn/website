Here's the complete <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/03-March/CMC/JPEG/" target="_top">album</a> of photos.  It was challenging to shoot because the lighting was so weird.  Nearly every center had different lighting.  I could see flashes going off from time to time.  I'm an ambient lighting kind of guy though.  I shot one with the flash because I was wanting some fill in a dark area.  I got the fill, but I also got some glare and weird colors on the rest of the images.  Since there was so many different lighting setups, I pretty much had to manually post-process every image.

Group all the photos by similar lighting configurations.  Go through and select the first image of each group of similar lighting conditions.  Double-click on this group of images.  Each image will open one at a time in Camera Raw.  You can set the conversion parameters and then Alt/Option click on the Update button.  As you Update, the next selected image opens.  After you get through with the whole selection you can go through and assign Camera Raw settings to the other images.  It's not a killer tip, but it's better than individually double-clicking on each image to open it in Camera Raw.

Tiffany photographs very well.  I did almost no post-processing on this image.  I was so pleased by how well it turned out.  There was overhead can lights shining directly down.  That glare in the background is from the light that's directly above that spot.  It seems like I should be able to reduce the effect of that glare in Photoshop.  If you know how, let me know.
