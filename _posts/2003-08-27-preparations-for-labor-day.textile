This Labor Day weekend we're going camping.  Carla's picked out a state park on one of the lakes near by hear.  I'm sorry I don't have the details.  Today during lunch we all went shopping for our camping supplies.  We got a fairly large tent on clearance for $80.  A couple of the kid-sized folding chairs for $5 each.  All in all we spent about $200 including snacks and things.  This could either turn out to be really fun or really funny.  I'll let you know which.
