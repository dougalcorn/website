Carla recently told of Kozmo's "love for bananas":http://carla.lathi.net/articles/2006/03/07/bananas.  Well, last night was the worst.  Kozmo pulled Joshua's pinewood derby car off the middle of the counter (reaching past the bananas) and proceeded to destroy it.  Not just a little teeth marks here an there that might be sanded out.  No, the entire front end of the car is toothpicks.  It really was a crushing blow.  The race is in just a little more than two weeks and now we have to completely start over.  Of course, "Carla's pretty upset":http://carla.lathi.net/articles/2006/03/08/pine-wood.  Josh was also upset but took the news well.  I think I did a pretty good job of walking the line between "this is really bad news and I'm sorry" versus "hey, we still have plenty of time to start over".  And really, this is good news/bad news.  Of course, it does suck that the car was destroyed.  On the other hand it means I'll be spending all day Saturday with Josh catching back up.
