Some of you may know the story of my run-in with the FBI.  Not many people have an FBI story to pull out at parties.  I'm like to get as much mileage out of it as I can.  One of my friends told me that a reporter with Fortune Magazine was doing a story on <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/EbayFraud">EbayFraud</a> and was looking for personal experiences.  So, I finally decided to write my story down and post it.  We'll see if I get my name in Fortune Magazine.  I guess that's probably the only way I'll see my name in Fortune; as a victim of some financial calamity. <img alt="whatever" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/indifferent.gif" />
