I finally bought <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><font color="#0000FF">MetroidPrime</font></span><a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/edit/Main/MetroidPrime?topicparent=Main.WebHome">?</a> for my <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/GameCube">GameCube</a>.  It's been a blockbuster for $19.99 for a long time.  I've been wanting them to lower their price and also apprehensive that someone else would buy it.  So, my worry won over my patience.  I'm not going to get to play it any until after Josh goes to bed.  It's rated "T" for violence.  There have been a couple of things in <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><font color="#0000FF">LegendOfZeldaWindWaker</font></span><a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/edit/Main/LegendOfZeldaWindWaker?topicparent=Main.WebHome">?</a> Carla and I were a little worried about Josh (or really Justin who watches Josh play) seeing.  I've heard this is a great game, I'm looking forward to playing.
