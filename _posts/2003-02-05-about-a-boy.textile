I watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Weitz,%20Chris" target="_top">Chris</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Weitz,%20Paul" target="_top">Paul Weitz</a>'s <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0276751" target="_top">"About A Boy"</a> last night.  Personally, I think this is one of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Grant,%20Hugh" target="_top">Hugh Grant</a>'s better films.  It's certainly not a romantic comedy.  In fact, I don't even really think it's a comedy.  I guess I was expecting something somewhat comedic.  Maybe if I were British I would think it was comedic.  But from my book it's firmly in the drama camp.  Of course, in looking at the one <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0276751#comment" target="_top">user comment</a> shown on <a href="http://imdb.com" target="_top">IMDB</a>'s page for the movie it says, "a sterling comic gem."  That "user" is clearly British.  No one from America would use the word "sterling" without relating to silver.
