I just heard someone explain Kernighan's Law:
<p />
<blockquote>
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the program, so if you
                   write the program as cleverly as you can, by definition,
                   you won't be clever enough to debug it.
</blockquote>
<p />
I hadn't heard it phrased quite that explicitly.  I have always said that when I code something particularly clever I usually throw it out.  I think I got that tip from one of Kernighan's books.
