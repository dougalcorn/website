It was my middle son, Justin's, first T-Ball game!  He's sat on the sidelines and watched his big brother play sports for more than a couple years.  He was very excited about it being his turn to play.

He's playing in the YMCA league.  We're very happy with it so far.  We had Josh playing in a local chapter of the official Little League Baseball.  The YMCA league seems much more focused on fun and learning.  I don't mean to trash Little League, but the YMCA league has a kid to coach ratio of like 4:1.  Today's game didn't score; everybody hits every inning, everybody runs!

Anyway, it was fun and I'm really pleased with the "photos":http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2006/07-July/T-Ball/.
