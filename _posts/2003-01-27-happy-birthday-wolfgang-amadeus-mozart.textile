Today is the 247th Anniversary of Mozart's birth.  I heard that on NPR today.  They followed up and said that he was lucky to survive.  The common thinking of doctor's of the day was that water was better for babies than mother's milk!  Now think about what their water was like!  I can't seem to find the right google phrase to verify or deny this.  Maybe someone who reads this knows someone involved in pediatrics who knows how to research it's history.
