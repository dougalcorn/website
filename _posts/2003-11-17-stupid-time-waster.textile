One of the games I like to play is "What would I do with $500".  I have a variant of the game called "What would I do with $5000".  That later game ends with an Apple Powerbook in my shoping cart.  See that's the fun part: you have to actually get the items in a shopping cart and then abort.  I'm sure this screws with store owner's statistics.  Anyway, the reason it's a stupid time waster is because I don't have $500 or $5000 of "mad money" and won't for the foreseeable future.  Anyway, I've added the items i usually end up with on my <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/WishList">WishList</a>.
