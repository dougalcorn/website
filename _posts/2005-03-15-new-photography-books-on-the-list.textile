On our date last night, my wife and I ended up at Barnes &#38; Noble back in the photography section.  I got a chance to checkout several books.  Two in particular turned me on.  The first is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0715316524/qid=1110890993/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-1456923-2180829?v=glance&#38;s=books&#38;n=507846" target="_top">Photographic Portrait</a> by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&#38;field-author=Robin%20Gillanders/002-1456923-2180829" target="_top">Robin Gillanders</a>; excellent commentary on the emotional thoughts behind making portraits.  <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0715316524.01._PE37_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" vspace="5" hspace="10" align="left" alt="Photographic Portrait by Robin Gillanders" />The other is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556708955/qid=1110891227/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/002-1456923-2180829" target="_top">How to Photograph Your Baby</a> by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&#38;field-author=Nick%20Kelsh/002-1456923-2180829" target="_top">Nick Kelsh</a>.  The book is a little cheesy, but is a nicely put together guide for non-photographers to get better photos of their baby.  I've just ordered a copy for some friends that are expecting.
<p />
I've also added some commentary on a couple other books I have on my <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/PhotographyBookList">PhotographyBookList</a>.  If any of you reading this have experience with a photography book, I'd like it if you'd add your review of the book on that page (good or bad).  I know there are lots of reviews on Amazon.com, but it's really hard to separate the wheat from the chaff.  I'd like to have a list of books  people I "know" recommend on photography.  Really this list should go somewhere like <a href="http://photogeeks.org" target="_top">http://photogeeks.org</a>, but I don't think they have a wiki up yet.
