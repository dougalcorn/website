I'm no scientist and I don't know much about alternative fuels; however, I see a lot of press for Hydrogen-based power.  I do know this: our oil-based economy has some nasty side-effects.  I've <a href="http://www.lathi.net/diary/2003/01/28#EntergyPolicy" target="_top">said before</a> that I think our nation needs a new engery policy.  I think we need something that can affect change in 10 years.  <a href="http://www.wired.com" target="_top">Wired Magazine</a> is featuring an <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/wiredmag/1,2167,58013,00.html" target="_top">article</a> about a five step Appolo-like plan to convert our energy sources to hydrogen in 10 years.  I don't know if hydrogen is really the best alternative; but, if someone can come up with a 10 year plan to get us off oil I'm all for it.

What's more, I think this issue could cement a Presidential election.  I think an election could hinge on one candidate supported a National Energy Policy and had a plan to convert America from foreign oil dependency.  There is a large percentage of the population that doesn't want the US in a war in the Middle-East.  That population isn't going to forget about it in just one year.
