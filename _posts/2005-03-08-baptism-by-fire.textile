One of my former coworkers recently graduated from Quantico as an FBI agent.  She stopped by the office today for the first time.  Talk about a huge buzz.  Everyone wanted to talk with her and hear all about it.  Yes, she was packing; Glock 22, .40 caliber, 15 rounds.  She showed her badge.  Talked about all kinds of cool stuff.  She's working in D.C. right now doing background checks on Presidential nominations.  This is just a temporary assignment though.
<p />
In 60 days she's transferring to her first real assignment: Public Corruption and Domestic Espionage in Chicago.  The corruption in Chicago is legendary at least as far back as Al Capone.  She confirmed that Cook county has the highest rate of corruption of any other counties in the US.  I'm a little surprised they gave her this assignment.  I'm sure she can hack it.  It just seems a little intense for right out of the shoot.
<p />
It took her about 15 months from the time she first applied for the FBI until they accepted her.  Once she finally got the offer she was pretty nervous about actually accepting it.  I'm glad she did.  It'll be exciting for her.  When you're young you've got to do stuff like that because it gets harder and harder as you get older.  It's cool to see her.  She's a manifestation of "going for it".
