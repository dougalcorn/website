Several weeks ago, I challenged Josh to save up enough money to buy the Spiderman game for his <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/GameCube">GameCube</a>.  I wasn't sure how expensive the game was, so I told him to save $40.  I made a chart for the refrigerator with 20 boxes on it (each box representing $0.50).  As he did things around the house to help without complaining we gave him an appropriate amount of money (anywhere from 50 cents to two bucks).  Yesterday he finally earned all of the $40.  I got home from Cleveland at about 7:30pm.  He couldn't wait to go to the store, so we went right away to the Mall.  I took him to Electronics Boutique.  They had a used copy of Spiderman for $17.  I let Josh pick the game out, give it to the man, give him his money, and buy the game.  He was very proud.  He was also surprised to find he had money left over.  I told him we'd put it into a savings account for him at the bank.  This worked out pretty well.  I think I'll make it a general rule that he needs to save twice as much money as something costs before he can buy it.  Maybe that will help develop the habit of saving money in the bank.  We took the game home and played a little bit before bed.  He's very happy with it.  Carla and I both have told him several times how proud we are of him for working to earn his money.
