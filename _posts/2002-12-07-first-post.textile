OK, I'm really excited about this.  I've been excited
about web logging (blogging) for quite some time.  Blogging is
basically a way to keep an on-line journal easily.  There are lots of
time throughout the day that I learn some interesting bit of news.
Often the kids do something that is noteworthy and should be recorded.
I also have several projects I'd like to keep notes on.

Thank goodness for <a href="http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/" target="_top">blosxom</a>!
I've written an article on my work integrating <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/BlosxomAndTWiki">BlosxomAndTWiki</a>.  So
far, I can reference documents in my TWiki in my blog.  Ultimately
I'll be able to show blog entries on my TWiki.  Really what I've done
is use the TWiki engine to pre-process the text of the blog entries.
