Since I've been gone so long, I don't know exactly when this started.  The boys have bunk-beds.  Every night we put each boy in their bed: Justin in the bottom bed, Josh in the top bed.  Lately each morning we find both boys in the top bed.  Josh at the head of the bed and Justin at the foot of the bed.  I guess there's no harm done.  Originally we were a little worried about Justin falling out of the top bed.  We've had the beds for a while now (like six months or more) and Justin is very comfortable with going up (and down!) the ladder.  Obviously this same bed sleeping arrangement can't go on forever.  I'm assuming a day will come when Justin feels more comfortable in his own bed than in Josh's.  Until that time comes I don't really have any problem with them sleeping together.  In a way, it's kinda cute.
