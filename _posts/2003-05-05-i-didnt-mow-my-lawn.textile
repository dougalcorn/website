I was out of town to Cleveland three weeks ago, very busy at home two weeks ago, and in Boulder, CO last week.  The long and short of it is I haven't spent very much time playing with the kids lately.  So, I made the decision to spend almost all of Saturday with them and almost all of yesterday after church with Josh.  I should have mowed my lawn.  It's been a full week since it was mowed with lots of rain last week.  I thought, "I'll do it tomorrow after work."  It's pretty much been raining solid since about 9:00 last night. <img alt="frown" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/frown.gif" />  It will take several days to dry out enough to mow if it were to stop raining right now.
