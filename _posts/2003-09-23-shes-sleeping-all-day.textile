Justin is doing much better about Josh going to school every day.  The first week or so he'd come back from taking Josh to school and just throw himself on the floor for about five or ten minutes.  He's still a little lonely in the mornings though.  Today he went in and woke Tiffany up just a few minutes ago (like 9:10am; keep in mind Josh goes to school at 8:30).  Carla went into her room to find Justin in there playing.  "Did you wake up your sister?"
<p />
To which Justin replied, "She's sleeping all day".
