No real surprise there.  It would have been a pretty big uphill discussion with my wife to get something like this.  However, I'd really like to have something like a <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/MythTV">MythTV</a> or a Tivo.  The flexibility of <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/MythTV">MythTV</a> over Tivo justifies the slightly higher price.  I really wanted to be talked into buying a PC to run <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/MythTV">MythTV</a>.  When I added up the <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/MythTVPrices">MythTVPrices</a> I realized what a lost cause it was. <img alt="frown" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/frown.gif" />
