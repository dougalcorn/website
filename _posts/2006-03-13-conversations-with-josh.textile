<blockquote>
Me: Tomorrow's a big day for your mom and I.  Do you know why?

Josh: Because we're getting a babysitter?

Me: heh, well, maybe.  But that's not the reason it's a big day.

Josh: Oh, yea.  It's like your 7th, 8th, or 9th anniversary!

Me: It's our 14th Anniversary.  We were married for 6 years before you were born.

Josh: You must have been miserable for those six years.

Me: Ha! Why's that?

Josh: Well, you must have been miserable being married with no kids.

Ah, to be young and naive...
