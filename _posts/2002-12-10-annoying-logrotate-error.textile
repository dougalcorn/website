I'm using logrotate from the debian/woody GNU/Linux distribution.  Somehow I've gotten an error in its configuration even though I haven't manyally changed anything.  Every stinking day I get mail from Anacron with this message:
<p />
<pre>
/etc/cron.daily/logrotate:
error running shared postrotate script for /var/log/apache/*.log 
run-parts: /etc/cron.daily/logrotate exited with return code 1
</pre>
<p />
When I trace it down, the postroate script is simply <code>/etc/init.d/apache reload &gt; /dev/null</code>  I've run that from the command line and verified it's return code is 0.  How annoying.
