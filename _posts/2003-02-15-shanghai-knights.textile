Carla and I went to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0300471" target="_top">Shanghai Knights</a> at the theater laste night.  It was entirely entertaining.  We laughed almost all the way through.  I did think <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Wilson,%20Owen" target="_top">Owen Wilson</a>'s character was more rakish than in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0184894" target="_top">Shanghai Noon</a>.
