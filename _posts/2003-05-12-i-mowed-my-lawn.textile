I know you guys really don't care how often I mow my lawn.  For me, mowing my lawn is like college.  Each term I started out with a bang; filled with entusiasm.  I read all the texts in preparation for class.  I worked all the example problems.  I did 100% of the homework.  My labs were as thorough and neat as any could be.  Each term I would wear down.  Slowly these "due diligences" were dropped along the wayside.  My goal was to actually make it all the way through the term with the same level of effort as I started with.  I graduated before I ever met that goal.  Now I'm perpetrating that same goal to my home owning.  I want to finish the summary with as much care and and entusiasm as I start with.  So, I'm trying to keep accurate records of what I do.  I <em>want</em> a nice lawn.  I just can't seem to be able to stick with it all the way through August.  Wish me luck for this year.
