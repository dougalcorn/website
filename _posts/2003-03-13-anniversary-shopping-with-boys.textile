Carla had a pretty tough day.  I actually don't know (remember) what all made it hard.  The point is that she didn't want to deal with all three kids.  Of course, I had waited until the last possible moment to do any shoping for our anniversary.  So, I ended up with both boys while I was shopping for Carla.  The first place I went to was a Hallmark store to pick out a card.  I walked in and did a quick survey of the nick-nacks.  From there I went directly back to the Anniversary card section.  By this time, I had been in the store about five minutes and said the words "Justin come here" at least 30 times.  Everyone is familar with the process of picking out a card: you read card after card telling you the feelings you're "supposed" to feel until you find something remotely close to what you actually feel.  So, I picked up my first card.  Of course, it wasn't the right card.

At this point, Josh pipes up with his favorite shoping phrase, "Are we going to go soon?"  Luckily Josh heard and understood my warning not to ask about leaving again.  In the end, I got a card and took the boys to Zainy-Brainy without getting Carla a present.
