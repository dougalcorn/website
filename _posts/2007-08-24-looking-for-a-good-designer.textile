My company is loosing a top notch designer.  He got a great gig locally with some big names in the usability field.  It's a great opportunity for him to advance his craft.  That leaves us without someone who has an eye to usability, standards compliant HTML/CSS, browser compatibility, and most importantly design.  if you are someone who is interested in the position or know someone who might be interested, please let me know.

Our previous designer worked remote with 25% on-site (roughly one week a month).  He was a FTE with travel expenses and remote office expenses paid.  We're looking for a similar arrangement ideally.  Well, ideally, we'd pay to relocate this person to Harrisonburg, VA as a FTE.  We're totally cool though with working remote with similar travel requirements.  As a last resort (or maybe as the interim solution) we'd hire someone on some type of contract for work.  I'm just a Sr. Developer/Team Lead, so I don't know the details of what such a contract would look like.

For those of you familiar with "_blah blah blah (lawyers made me change this)_":http://corporatetool.blogspot.com/, we're a language learning software company.  We're profitable and privately held.  We're growing fast and going through a lot of internal change.  We have new recruiters, so the hiring process should go smoothly.  Contact me at dalcorn@rosettastone.com if you're interested.
