One of our friends is a nurse.  We (really Carla) occationally (more often than not) watch her son while she works.  Today she brought her stuff over and pulled the stitches out of Princess.  I didn't see it happen, but Carla said Princess did really well with the whole thing.  Carla said she didn't show any discomfort.  So, that saved us about $75.  I'm a little nervous that the Vet hasn't seen Princess to assess her progress.  Officially we're not supposed to have a checkup for several more weeks.

At this point we're just supposed to make sure Princess gets two five minute walks a day.  That doesn't sound like much, but it's 10 more minutes a day that she was getting before. <img alt="wink" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/wink.gif" />
