I'm here in Denver for "RubyConf 2006":http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/.  Most of the people I only know online.  So I'm walking around introducing myself to various folks.  Some I already knew and some are new.  I wanted to make a point of speaking to "Nathaniel Talbot":http://blog.talbott.ws/.  I saw him at breakfast and walked over to re-introduce myself.  There were a couple other guys there with him whom I also introduced myself.  One of them introduced himself simply as "Matz".  Pause.  Click.  "Oh, hey!  Thanks, man."

BTW, if you can hear my voice and want to hook up to talk about emacs and ruby or something, let me know.  I'm 'lathinet' on AIM.  My cell is 513-295-2844.
