Back in January I started a "new job that lets me work from home":http://blog.lathi.net/articles/2006/01/03/my-christmas-gift-of-rails.  The first order of business was to setup my own office.  Prior to this, my wife and I had been sharing a desk.  We did a lot of work to clean out our basement and set me up a working space down there.  Just prior to this, my Dad had visited and seen what a total pit my basement was.  After we finished cleaning it up, I was so proud I made "this little video":http://lathi.net/movies/Basement.mov (Apple "Quicktime":http://www.apple.com/quicktime, 3MB).  I'm just now getting around to doing anything with it and I thought I'd share it.  

Looking back at this video, the basement really doesn't look that clean.  Just note that there's a lot less stuff in it.
