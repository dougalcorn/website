On the way back from the <a href="http://lathi.net/diary/Christianity/men_s_retreat.html" target="_top">men's retreat</a> I was driving out in the middle of Nowhere, Kentucky.  Not unusually, I passed a dead (and rotting) deer by the side of the road.  What was unusual was there must have been 30 vultures of some type nearly swarming the carcass.  It all sounds gross, but it was actually kind of cool.  It was something so out of my ordinary experience I was fascinated.  I don't think I've ever seen a wild vulture.  There was one tree that had about 20 of the giant birds all perched in it's limbs.  Several other trees also had vultures in it.  There was three or four bold enough to be down by the road.
<p />
I had all my camera gear with me.  It only took me about 10 seconds to decide to pull over.  I swapped out my 70 - 200mm lens and walked back towards the birds.  I was able to get within about 30 feet of them.  I started to compose my first shot and meter the light.  Nothing happens.  I don't have <em>any</em> battery left at all; not a single shutter release!

I've ordered a second battery.
