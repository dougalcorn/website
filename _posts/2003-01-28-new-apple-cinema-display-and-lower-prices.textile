I've admired the Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/" target="_top">displays</a> for quite a while.  Just recently they've announced a new model and lowered prices across the board.  The <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/acd20/" target="_top">20" Cinema display</a> is 1680x1050 and only $1300.  They've reduced the price of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/acd23/" target="_top">23" HD Cinema display</a> has been lowered to an even $2000 for 1980x1200.  Yes, that's still a lot of money.  However, for large LCD flat panels that's a really good price.  At work we pay about $2500 for an NEC 20" LCD that only displays 1280x1024.
