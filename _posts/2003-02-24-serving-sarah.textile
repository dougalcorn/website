Carla got a couple of movies for us to watch this weekend.  The first we watched (it was actually back on Thursday; hope you don't mind the lag too much) was <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0261289" target="_top">Serving Sarah</a>.  Yes, I know my mom and dad told me they walked out of this film.  I still wanted to watch it because I was curious.  I mean <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Hurley,%20Elizabeth" target="_top">Elizabeth Hurley</a> and what's his name? Chandler? No...  <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Perry,%20Matthew" target="_top">Matthew Perry</a>.  Well, I can see why my folks walked out.  The initial scenes has some quite crude language.  It wasn't overtly foul, just in your face crude.  These were the scenes where Perry sets himself up as a tough guy.  That's right, Perry plays a tough guy.  That's really where this movie starts to fall flat.  It really goes splat when he and Hurley "fall in love".  It's like watching the Homecoming Queen make go out with the President of the Chess Club.  The only reason she would do it is as a joke.  Besides "flat" I can only think of two more words to describe this film: "No chemistry".  Three years from now when this is showing on TBS, go ahead and watch it (assuming it's Saturday afternoon and you don't want to watch any of the golf matches).  Until then, save your $4 on the rental.
