Again.  We finally got all our ducks in a row to have Tiff's birthday party yesterday.  I guess if I were a good blogger, I would have written about it yesterday.  In fact, if I had I could have included a picture or two with this blog entry.  However, I'm in <a href="http://www.lathi.net/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2003/1/27#Commute_ClevelandsAPlum" target="_top">Cleveland</a> this week and don't have access to the camera to download the pictures.
<p />
It was a "small" party and a big success in my book.  We had two families over from church (the Talaber's and Lowry's) and their kids.  Overall there were 13 of us.  Heh, I didn't realize the "unlucky" number until now.  If your superspicious, go ahead and add my dog in to make 14.  Carla made the cake.  I personally think this is the best cake she's made in years.  Maybe since we've moved to Ohio.  Of course, her cakes always <em>taste</em> good; but this one looked fabulous.  As soon as I can I'll try to get pictures.  The cake was two layers with a small upright bear on top.  Tiff got the bear all to herself.  It took her a few minutes to figure out how to eat it, but eventually "dove into it".  Let me say it one more time: we got some good pictures of all this.
<p />
Carla fixed "country pork ribs" for lunch.  They are really just slabs of pork that are boneless.  I'm not smart enough to know any more about the cut or anything.  She dumped them all in her new 7 quart crockpot with a bunch of barbecue.  Twelve hours later it was very tender, juicy, fall-apart pork.  Of course, we fixed way too much.  Great pork sandwiches though!
<p />
The one frustrating thing about the party.  Our stupid camcorder's battery is nearly toast.  To make matters worse, we've lost the special cable that allows us to plug the camera directly into the battery's charger.  So, we can charge the battery (which takes about 9 hours) and use the camera off batter (for about 30 minutes) or just not use the camera. <img alt="frown" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/frown.gif" />  The moral of that story is while we got lots of good pictures of Tiff, we didn't get nearly as much video as we wanted.  Our camera's so old, I'm not sure we can get a battery (or the AC adapter cable) for it any more.  Definitely added near the top of my todo list.
