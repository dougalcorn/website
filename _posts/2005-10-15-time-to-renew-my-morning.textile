</a>It may seem mundane to you, but I'm very excited about my new coffee pot!  I got a "Mr. Coffee 10-Cup, Black with Brushed Chrome Accents, Thermal Programmable Coffeemaker - ISTX85.":http://www.mrcoffee.com/productdetail.aspx?id=165 It's one of those appliances I use very regularly, but don't upgrade very often.

My last coffee maker was one of those freebies from "Gevalia":http://www.gevalia.com/Gevalia/ ("this":http://www.brokentype.com/blog/000158.html i the funniest story about Gevalia I've read).  I really liked that it used a thermal carafe instead of those "warming plates" (aka coffee scorchers).  The down side was that it was white plastic and only 8 cups.  After years of use, the white plastic parts had become quite stained.  Also, it was taking 45 minutes to brew those meager 8 cups!  I know I could have run vinegar through it like 100 times to get all the calcification out; but I'm too lazy for that.

This new coffee maker has a chrome carafe; so no stains to worry about.  It also has a timer!  Seems like a small thing, but it's very exciting to wake up to coffee already made.  Catering to my lazy nature, it's also got some type of a sensor that tells me when it needs to be cleaned/de-calicfied and then an automatic mode for doing the cleaning.  All I have to do is mix up the vinegar solution when it tells me and press a buttong.  The one thing I wish it had is a built in grinder.  I'm going for the ultimate laziness here!  I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for it though.

Speaking of which, it's not every day you get to rip off Wal-Mart.  You can see on the web site above that the MSRP for this coffee maker is $59.99.  I found it at Target for $56.  Wal-Mart had it for $54.  However, the "display" unit was labeled as an 8-cup maker for $38.  I asked for help from someone and said I wanted the 8-cup version.  She looks around and doesn't see any boxed up, "Sorry, we're sold out."  So, she let me buy the display unit!  I could see boxed versions of "mine" clearly labeled as a 10-cup for $54.  But they still let me have it for $38!  So I guess the net result is that I got the maker for $16 less and helped push more jobs over to China.
