This is actually the movie Carla sent me to get Saturday night.  She was able to get it for last night.  I had heard this was a pretty pour film and I wasn't really looking forward to seeing it.  As with many things, coming in with low expectations I was pleasently surprised.  Hugh Grant was actually quite good.  Sandra Bullock is cute.  The writing was OK.  I laughed out loud more than once.  What more could you want from a romantic comedy?
