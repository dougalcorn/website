It seems like the RIAA has a right to make a profit.  The problem is their profit isn't enough.  Their customers just aren't giving them enough money.  No, those filthy pirates are raiding their homes and taking food off their table by downloading and sharing music.  Somebody should pay for all that music.  Maybe since the Internet Service Providers are selling broadband connections that allow the music to be downloaded they should be forced to pay a fee to the RIAA.  Yea, that's it.  That's the ticket.  Just look at how many <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,57326,00.html" target="_top">supporters</a> the idea has gotten so far.
