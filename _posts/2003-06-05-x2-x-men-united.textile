I went with <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/FrankRiha">FrankRiha</a> last night to see the new <a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=A278281" target="_top">X2: X-Men</a>.  I thought it was a good film.  I like the <a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=A187123" target="_top">first</a> one too.  Of course, the whole premise of the X-Men is evolution.  So, you have to accept this as the fiction it is.  That said, the characters are engaging and the story is fairly unique.  It's not just an action flik.  Like the last one, it does spent time on both story and character development.  The acting is superb as is the directing.  There is a lot more action in this film.  What that means is there is a lot more killing in this film.  Wolverine does as Wolverine is.  He actually get's to do his signature move of picking guys up with his claws and tossing them away.  That said, there's also some good moral value to the film.  The overall theme of the X-Men in general is fear versus faith.  This film accentuates that.  The bad guys fear what they don't know and try to destroy it.  The good guys have faith that eventually "we" can all work together.  Overall, I recommend it.  I'll back off and say I recommend it for adults.  My kids won't see it for some time.  There are more than a few freakish things in it I wouldn't want emblazened on their fresh little minds.
