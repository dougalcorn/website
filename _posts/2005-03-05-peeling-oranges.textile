Josh has learned to peel oranges this week.  He asked me last night (just before bed) if he could peel some oranges.  I told him he could in the morning.  When I  got up today he was peeling away.

"Peeling oranges is the best thing I've ever done!"
<p />
"Peeling oranges kinda makes me feel like the dad"
<p />
"I think peeling oranges is my talent!"

In fact, right now as I'm typing this he's saying, "Aren't you going to come eat these oranges?  They're getting cold."  You've got to love the enthusiasm of youth.
