Of those, I only liked about seven.  When push came to shove, I only posted four of them to my gallery.  You can find the images <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/03-March/N%20Pole%20Bridge/JPEG/" target="_top">here</a>.

An interesting thing.  I shot for a bit with Britton's "kit" lens.  It's a cheap 18 - 50mm/F3.5-5.6 (not really sure about the aperture range).  Lots of people trash this lens.  I've also heard good results.  Britton said he doesn't think he's ever gotten a single good image off of it.  I wanted some first hand experience with it; plus it's 10mm wider than my widest focal length.  In landscape photography with a 1.6 crop factor that's a lot.
<p />
Of the four photos I posted, two were with the kit lens and two were with my Canon 28-135/3.5-5.6 IS USM.  I'm really learning to like that lens.  I wish I could open the aperture a little wider (like a stop or two), but it's very fast to focus, quite sharp, and pretty good colors.

You can judge for yourself the difference between these two lenses.  Yes, the kit lens is wider.  But my images didn't turn out as good.  So really, I "missed" the shot because the glass wasn't good enough.  In defense of the kit lens though, I was manually focusing in pre-dawn light.  This lack of sharpness could just be that I missed the focus.
