title: So how does a Cub Scout Cake Auction Work?

I was a little curious how this whole thing was going to go down.  It turns out it was pretty fun, but expensive.  We had a real auctioneer come in to sell the cakes.  When he first started talking, most of the boys (including Josh) started laughing.  They thought he was just trying to be silly or something.  So one of the scout leaders would bring a cake up and the auctioneer would sell it.  <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/01-January/Cake%20Auction/2005-01-19_13.jpg"><img src="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/01-January/Cake%20Auction/.cache/100x66-2005-01-19_13.jpg" width="100" height="66" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" border="0" alt="Auctioneer and a cake" /></a>There were a few boys who did their own bidding.  I don't know of they had a gift budget from their parents for the night or if it was their own money.  Mostly the boys sat by their parents and told them which cakes they wanted while the parents bid.  Josh wanted to do his own bidding, but didn't understand how to stop bidding.  He thought it was like school, "Ooo! Ooo! Pick me! I want that cake!"  It was totally crazy which cakes brought how much.  The dividing line was about $20; about half the cakes went for less and about half went for more.  Before coming, I had told Josh we had a budget of $20 for the cake we were going to buy.  I guess that was a little low.  There really wasn't any cakes below the $20 mark that we wanted.  
<p />
All the cakes were on display at the back of the room.  I told Josh to go pick out three cakes he wanted to bid on.  Of course, he comes back with two of the most popular cakes plus his own.  So here's my dilemma: which cake to bid on.  The one he really wants is a very cool "The Incredibles" cake that more than a few boys are going to want.  His number two pick (a green snake) actually comes up for auction before his number one pick.  Should I go ahead and get his #2 for fear his #1 will be too high?  I'd hate to not bid on his #2 at all and then flat out loose his #1.  Turns out the point is moot.  The green snake sells for $35 and "The Incredibles" cake sells for I think $30.

I don't know if I'll be able to buy it back or not.  A fairly nice, store-bought, Oreo cake come up for auction.  The auctioneer thinks it's an Ice Cream cake.  I think, "That'd be a cool cake."  It's not going for very much, so I bid on it.  I win the cake for $15.  Josh is crushed.  He didn't want that cake.  He wants his own cake.  So I'm trying to talk him into wanting this cake.  Finally, as one of the last cakes, his comes up for auction.  He really wants it.  What I should have done is just stick to my $20 budget and called it a night.  What I did was buy his cake back for $27.  So, I ended up spending $42 for the evening.  (Yes, I know that's a pretty amateurish photo.  I used the flash and was too close.)

As we're leaving, I'm talking to a few of the parents getting things squared away for our next Den meeting.  Josh is holding his Sponge Bob cake.  One of his friends asks if he can have some of the icing.  Josh, being very generous, says yes.  So the boy reaches up and takes one of the eyes off the top of the cake!  By this time both the boy's mother and I are there.  Josh is doing OK, but the mother realizes this isn't a good thing.  So this boy is holding a big glob of icing that is Sponge Bob's eye.  Josh tells him to put it back.  His mother (as mothers do) thinks about the whole "germ thing" and tells him he can't put it back.  Josh would be perfectly happy with Sponge Bob's eye back where it belongs with or without germs.  I'm not certain on the "5 second rule" of "one you touch it you can't put it back" and end up agreeing with the mother.  Josh looses it.  I do my best to console my boy, but I never get him back past the tipping point.  In his defense, what I didn't realize at the time is that he's finally caught the nasty cold business that's been going around.  So, I'll pull out the "he's tired and doesn't feel well."
<p />
So, I'm coming home with two cakes.  Carla's going to make another birthday cake for Tiffany's party in two days.  Obviously coming home with two cakes isn't the right thing to do.  So as we're leaving the Pack Meeting there's a young lady parked next to us leaving at the same time.  I asked her if she got a cake.  Turns out she was up at this church building for something totally unrelated.  So I give her the Oreo cake (which wasn't ice cream).  Turns out that by this time Josh has become attached to this cake too.  He gets really upset that I gave away the cake.  "You're just doing this on purpose to make me mad so I'll act tired and you can send me to bed!"
<p />
I did my best "let's be reasonable" appeal, but never really got very far.  In the end I think he was still mad at the way I handled the whole thing.  By the time we got home he was in a better mood.  However, I think it was Grandma and Grandpa's expected arrival a few minutes later that really lifted his spirit!
