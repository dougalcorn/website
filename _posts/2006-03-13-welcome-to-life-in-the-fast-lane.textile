Oh happy day!  My Macbook Pro has finally arrived!  Migration from my old Powerbook to the Macbook Pro took about an hour and a half.  Everything went really smoothly.  I lost my VPN configs and had to redo those by hand.  I'm not sure what all else I lost.  Definitely some registration codes.  I need to spend some more time checking stuff out; particularly the stuff from Darwin Ports and running my Rails tests.  More later...
