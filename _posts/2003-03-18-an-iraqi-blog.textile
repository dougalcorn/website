I think I've blogged on this before.  If you want to get a glimpse of how some of the "other half" live, take a look at <a href="http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/" target="_top">Dear Raed</a>.  It's a group blog on <a href="http://www.blogger.com" target="_top">Blogger.com</a> written by a few Iraqis.  I think they are all pretty much in their 20s.  It's very interesting to get their perspectives on things and what their lives are like.  <a href="http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/2003_03_01_dear_raed_archive.html#89992632" target="_top">This</a> is a particularly interesting piece talking about the burning of oil and the social connotations associated with it.  Blogger seems to be getting hammered.  I bet this site's hit count is going to go through the roof over the next several weeks.
