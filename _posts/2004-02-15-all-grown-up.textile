Joshua had his Valentine's Day party on Friday.  On Saturday we happily wished each other "Happy Valentine's Day", but it was otherwise a pretty normal day.  We went shoping as a family came home and did normal Saturday chores.  That night after bath time Josh comes up with his usual, "I have a question."
<p />
"If today is Valentine's Day, why didn't we do anything fun?"
<p />
"What do you mean 'fun'?  We spent some fun time out shoping, bought you a new game, and you and Justin got to play it most of the afternoon.  What more fun things did you want to do?"
<p />
"I don't know.  Whatever fun things you're supposed to do for Valentine's Day."
<p />
Obviously he's thinking if Valentine's Day is a holiday there must be some "fun" celebration involved; like Christmas, Easter, Halloween and the like.  I decide I should help him understand the "spirit of the season".
<p />
"Valentine's Day is about telling others how much you love them.  It's about telling them 'thank you' for all they do for you and how much you appreciate them."  Of course, I'm not sure Josh really knows what the word "appreciate" means.  We talk about it enough; but, it's just not sinking in.  I go on, "It would make your mother very happy if you'd go downstairs and tell her that you love her, appreciate her, and you'd like her to 'be your Valentine.'"  I'm thinking Carla's going to love this.  What mother wouldn't love unabashed admiration and love expressed from her kids?
<p />
In stead Josh replies, "Uhh, I think I'd rather just go to bed."  All ready he's acting like a grown up guy. <img alt="wink" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/wink.gif" />
