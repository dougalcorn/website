Surprisingly, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/03/christian_sir_mixalo.html" target="_top">Boing Boing</a> pointed out <a href="http://lathi.net/babygotbook.avi" target="_top">this satire</a> (warning: that link is to the 17MB AVI video) of Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back".  Usually, Boing Boing is pretty down on Christianity.  Their posts usually point out the absurd things Christians are saying and doing.  I'm not really a rap fan, but wanted to see what Boing Boing was saying about Christianity this time.  Boy, was I surprised.  This is actually a very good spoof.  The whole thing is about a rapper/DJ talking about how he likes girls who read their Bible.  He does make a big deal about big Bibles versus small Bibles, but I think it's just a tool to make the spoof of off "Baby Got Back" work.  He also makes a jab at girls who dress immodestly.

Anyway, I think in general, moderate Christians would find this entertaining and not offensive.  Christian teens would probably find this funny and entertaining too.
