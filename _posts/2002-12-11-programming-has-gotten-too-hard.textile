So just how big is the world of programming?  Joel Spolsky thinks it's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LordPalmerston.html" target="_top">so big</a> it really several unmeasuruably large worlds: Windows Programming, Machintosh Programming, Unix Programming, Java Programming.  He posits that programming used to be 90% skills and 10% knowlege of the API but that this has flipped.

<blockquote>
So for now, my advice is this: don't start a new project without at
least one architect with several years of solid experience in the
language, classes, APIs, and platforms you're building on. If you have
a choice of platforms, use the one your team has the most skills with,
even if it's not the trendiest or nominally the most productive. And
when you're designing abstractions or programming tools, go the extra
mile to make them <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html" target="_top">leak proof</a>.
