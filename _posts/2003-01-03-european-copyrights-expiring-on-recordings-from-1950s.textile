I'm honestly surprised by this.  The <a href="http://www.boycott-riaa.com/" target="_top">RIAA</a> and Mike Eisner have been trying very hard to keep copyrights from ever expiring.  Here in the US they've (somewhat) recently been extended to 95 years.  In Europe, copyrights are only 50 years.  That means some of the orginal recordings from the 50's are starting to enter the (<strong>gasp</strong>) <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/04/02/lessig.html" target="_top">public domain</a>.
<p />
The New Yord Times has an <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=68&amp;ncid=716&amp;e=15&amp;u=/nyt/20030102/ts_nyt/european_copyrights_expiring_on_recordings_from_1950_s" target="_top">article</a> on this.  Mostly sound bites for those who are trying to extend copyrights.  I hope this is a loop-hole that will actually allow works to enter the public domain and be accessible to Americans.  What could happen is that European artists/musicians woule have more content in the public domain allowing them to use it in new works.  If ther happens, then it's likely we'll see better new content coming out of Europe rather than Hollywood or Nashville.
