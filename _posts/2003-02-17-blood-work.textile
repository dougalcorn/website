After a long weekend painting, Carla and I decided to watch a movie.  The kids were just in bed, there was already at least four inches of snow and ice on the ground, and we definitely didn't want to go to the movie store.  Luckily for $4 we were able to watch <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0309377" target="_top">Blood Work</a> on pay-per-view.  Carla and I both agreed it was a successful transaction.  We enjoyed the movie, didn't have to go get it, and definitely no late fees.  I guess I probably enjoyed it more than Carla; it's tough to say.  She figured it out much sooner than I did.  So from that standpoint, I had more suspense and then a hightened sense of "Ah ha" when they revealed who, what, when, and how.  For a crime suspense/thriller it's a pretty good film.  It's directed, produced, and staring <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Eastwood,%20Clint" target="_top">Clint Eastwood</a> with a surprising role from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Daniels,%20Jeff" target="_top">Jeff Daniels</a> (of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0109686" target="_top">Dumb and Dumber</a> fame; which I didn't like).
