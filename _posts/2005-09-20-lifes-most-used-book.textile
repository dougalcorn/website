I saw this billboard for SBC Yellow Pages:

<blockquote>
Life's most used book(TM)
</blockquote>

I don't know if there's statistical validation for this claim or not.  Personally, I hope it's not true for me.  I'd hate to think the book I use most is primarily for shopping.  When it's all said and done, I hope the Bible is the book I use most.

I believe the Bible is true and an accurate representation of God and how He wants us to Live.
