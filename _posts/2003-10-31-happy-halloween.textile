I've uploaded some <a href="http://www.lathi.net/cgi-bin/ids/index.cgi?mode=album&amp;album=/2003/October/Halloween" target="_top">photos</a> of the kids on Halloween.  There's also a couple of pictures of some neighbor kids.  After it's all over Josh, Justin, Carla and I were sitting around with the candy.  The boys are eating a few pieces before bed.  Josh says, "Are you going to leave the candy out for us in the morning?"  We said we weren't; that we didn't want them to eat too much of it.  "Are you going to throw it away?"  We are such bad parents.  What planet does he think we're from to throw away his Halloween candy?  I feel so badly that we've traumatized him in some way like that.  Anyway, enjoy the pictures.  I also uploaded some pictures of <a href="http://www.lathi.net/cgi-bin/ids/index.cgi?mode=album&amp;album=/2003/October/School-Trip" target="_top">Josh's school field trip</a> and our trip to the <a href="http://www.lathi.net/cgi-bin/ids/index.cgi?mode=album&amp;album=/2003/October/Pumpkin-Patch" target="_top">pumpkin patch</a>.
