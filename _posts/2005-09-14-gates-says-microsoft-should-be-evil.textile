This is a funny quote from Bill Gates.  I don't really think he meant the way it sounds, but it's nice to have it in print!  This is from a CNET interview:

<blockquote>
<p>*So that would be the philosophical difference between Microsoft and what Google is up to at this point?*</p>
<p>Gates: Well, we don't know everything they are up to, but we do know their slogan and we disagree with that.</p>
</blockquote>

If you've been living under a rock for the last five years, Google's philosophy/slogan is "Do No Evil".  It's a poke at the popular perception of how Microsoft runs their company.

So taken literally, Bill is saying he disagrees with doing no evil.  Wonder what he really meant?
