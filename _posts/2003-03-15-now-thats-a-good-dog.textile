I don't remember exactly what was happening.  Carla and I were playing with the kids.  It was getting a little late.  Justin was tire.  I don't remember what set him off.  I think I was doing something with Josh when Justin wanted some specific attention.  Anyway, he let's loose with his heart-broken, indignant cry with no signs of letting up.  As I said, I don't remember exactly what set him off, so I can't really comment.  What I do remember is that neither Carla nor I had much sympathy for him.  It was a classic case of Justin not getting what he wanted and throwing a fit.  We try not to humor those kinds of fits any more than we have to.  Princess on the other hand was a little more disturbed by it.  I think it's easier for us to ignore the crying than it is her.  
<p />
Keep in mind that Princess is about nine years old.  She's lived (or is living) through three babies.  All of them adore chasing her, pulling her hair, and squeezing her.  She's very aware of this and handles it well.  She handles it by avoiding the kids as much as possible.
<p />
So, back to the story.  Knowing this about Princess, she comes and sits next to the crying Justin.  After a few seconds, Justin opens his eyes enough to notice Princess.  Without stopping crying, he puts hits hand on Princess and slowly starts petting.  After another few seconds his crying stops.  Apparently Princess dislikes crying more than she fears Justin.
