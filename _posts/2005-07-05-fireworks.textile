I'm not really all that hip on fireworks in general.  I know everyone is supposed to like fireworks, and I do.  It's just not as big a deal with me as others.
<p />
However, they do present a fairly good photographical challenge.  So, I spent the entire fireworks display standing behind my tripod.  All of these were shot with bulb time.  Of course, I didn't remember my remote shutter release.  So I had to stand there with my finger on the shutter button.  The other problem was that I didn't realize how far away they'd be from me.  I thought I'd need a wider angle lens than a telephoto.  So, I shot these with my Canon 28-135mm/3.5-5.6 IS USM.  I wish I had brought my Sigma 70-200mm/2.8 instead.  I could have used tighter cropping on many of these.
<p />
I shot these from across the Interstate from where the fireworks were launched from.  That means you can see street lights in the bottom of the pictures.  Also, there's a hotel's sign in many of them.
<p />
I'm not actually sure how I would have done a better job shooting these.  Even still I'm not very happy with them.  I guess they're cool.  They're just not "wow-ing".  With that ringing endorsement, be sure to take a look!
