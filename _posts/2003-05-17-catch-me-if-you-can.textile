We rented <a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=A249845" target="_top">"Catch Me If You Can"</a>.  I'm definitely not a Leonardo <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><font color="#0000FF">DiCaprio</font></span><a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/edit/Main/DiCaprio?topicparent=Main.WebHome">?</a> fan.  This may actually be the first film he's done that I like.  To his credit, I pretty much forget that it's actually DiCaprio on film.  The story itself is so engaging.  I did, however, have a hard time forgetting it was <a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=B93341" target="_top">Tom Hanks</a> on screen.  I guess he did a pretty good job in this role.  It just wasn't one of his best.  I was pleased to hear this movie was based on the autobiography of Frank Abagnale, Jr.  At some point I'll probably pick up the book and read it.
