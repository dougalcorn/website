Now that my kids are nearing the end of the infant stage, it's somewhat fun to see new fathers.  I don't mean this to <a href="http://www.lathi.net/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/Movies/WhichMovie.writeback" target="_top">make fun</a> of them.  It's just good to compare how well I did versus what I see other <a href="http://www.yerot.com/~yerase/blog/blosxom.cgi/Family/partyboy.writeback" target="_top">guys going through</a>.  Since I've been through it more than a couple times, I'll offer up some "words of wisdom".
<p />
Randall's feelings are pretty similar to what mine were.  I never really thought that I <em>wouldn't</em> have kids; however, I never really thought much <em>about</em> having kids.  When the time came, I felt woefully under prepaired and more than a little nervous about the whole thing.  When each of my kids first came, I didn't really know what to do.  I was uncomfortable being around them and doing all the stuff you have to do with infants.  It wasn't much fun for me.  There were certainly moments when it was enjoyable.  These little moments of enjoyment slowly came more and more frequent.  When I say slowly, I mean like slowly over the whole first year.  For me, though, something happens when they turn one.  It doesn't magically become easy; however, that's about the time it becomes noticably more fun. 
<p />
Of course I write this while Tiffany is standing next to me screaming in unhappiness about something.  Even with Josh at five, it's not "easy".  I don't know when it'll get "easy".  I still struggle knowing what to do most of the time.  Being a dad isn't "natural" to me.  However, I do enjoy it.  Each of my kids are very special to me.  I feel like I have a pretty good relationhsip with each of them individually.  I have quite often we have intimate time with them.

I guess I need that time in the first year or so to build up a relationship with them.  In general, I don't make relationship easily.  I've found I just need time to build up relationships.  I think relationships are really the sum of all the little things you know about people.  That's why I think web logs are such a good idea.  It's a way to share the little things day in and day out.  Friends move away or live a long way away.  It's hard to keep those relationships strong.  I think the reason is because you don't keep up with all the little things.  You don't know what's happening in "the thick" of their lives.  Anyway, this switched from me talking about my kids and how I've really <em>grown</em> to love them over time to a plea for friends to keep weblogs. <img alt="wink" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/wink.gif" />
