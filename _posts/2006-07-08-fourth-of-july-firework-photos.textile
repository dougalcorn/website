Yes, I still remember how to post photos.  Here's a handful of "pics I took on the Fourth":http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2006/07-July/Fireworks/ of our local fireworks show in "Sharonville, OH":http://maps.google.com/maps?q=sharonville,+oh&ie=UTF8&om=1.

I think they turned out a little better than "last year":http://blog.lathi.net/articles/2005/07/05/fireworks.  I credit that to remembering my remote shutter release.
