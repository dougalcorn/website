It was a great day of photography and hiking.  The weather had been a little cool and wet all week and several of the group backed out.  They really missed out!  Our temps were around 55 degrees F; which was perfect given our exertion level.  We could have used a little more sun shine, but we still had pretty good light.  The hiking was the most fun I've had in a long time.  My body's sore today, but my spirit was soaring Saturday.

I was really the only one photographing while we were hiking.  I had my 50mm/F1.8 on and was snapping lots of pictures.  I felt a little rushed because no one else was really shooting.  They were all waiting until they got to the falls themselves. So, most of my photos were mediocre or bad.  I did end up with a good <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/03-March/Clifty%20Falls/JPEG/" target="_top">dozen photos</a> including a great one of the <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/03-March/Clifty%20Falls/JPEG/2005-03-26_75.jpg" target="_top">Big Clifty Falls</a>.
