Getting ready for church this morning.  Josh had gotten up early and was in the basement playing games on his computer.  Carla asked him to go get dressed (having laid his clothes out for him).  When he came back down, he was dressed.  He was wearing his church clothes.  He was also wearing his Spiderman costume under his church clothes.
