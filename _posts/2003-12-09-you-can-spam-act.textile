It looks like the Internet will be clogged with even more spam.  Congress has passed a much-criticised anti-spam bill called (I kid you not) "Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act" (CAN-SPAM).  The Register has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/34413.html" target="_top">covered the bill</a> with a short write-up.  The gist is that spammers have to honor our opt-out request (rather than requiring opt in like Europe does).  So yes, Virginia, <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/news.lasso?article=150" target="_top">you CAN-SPAM</a>.  Further they've taken away California's right to allow spam recipients to "sue their tormentors" (as The Register puts it).  The only good news is that it's now illegal to forge the return address on spam.  It's also illegal for them to misappropriate resources for the purpose of sending spam.  That means no using open relays or open proxies.  I'm not sure what type of punishment comes from doing so.  I hope it's jail time in a Federal pen.  According to <a href="http://spamhaus.org/" target="_top">http://spamhaus.org/</a>, a major anti-spam player, another benifit from the bill is that it should be easier to track where the spam is coming from.  The bill also legalizes ISPs ability to enforce their own email policies (i.e. blocking spam).  We'll see what 2004 brings to our mailboxes.
