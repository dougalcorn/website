They sell refurbished and used monitors at pretty good prices.  While I don't get anything from them for posting this link, I wanted it in my blog so I could search for it easily.

My consulting company bought me a used 19" at a previous engagement.  It was OK.  It worked consistently and calibrated pretty well.  My only complaint was that it was not as sharp as I'd like.  I guess that's the risk you take with buying used gear over the net.  If I had the energy (and it was my money), I probably would have tried to work with them on getting the monitor to perform better.

Anyway, if you don't want to drop a pile of cash on a fancy new LCD check these guys out.
