Justin has never been what you might call a "good sleeper".  We're pretty much always fought with him at bed time.  Josh, on the other hand, has pretty much always gone to bed when told to and fallen asleep right away.  Justin is now 27 months old.  Today I called the house to talk to Carla and was totally unsuccessful.  I couldn't have communicated with her any worse if she simply hadn't answered the phone.  Justin was so angry about being made to take a nap his screaming/crying drowned out any conversation she and I might have had.  Unfortunately, I don't remember when Josh quit taking afternoon naps.  Maybe he was three or four.  Seems like he was done with them by four.  I just don't remember.  Is this too soon to take Justin off the afternoon naps?
