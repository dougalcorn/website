The boys and I were heading up to Middletown for the Balloon Festival this weekend (pictures to come later).  We were traveling the back roads up there and passed by a cow pasture.  I don't know exactly how many cows were in the field.  I'm guessing somewhere between 50 and 100 crowded in the corner of this field.  It wasn't a mind boggling number, but certainly more than we're used to seeing in one place in these parts.  So I said, "Boys, look at all those cows."

Without missing a beat Josh said, "If there were an evil cow those could be its army."  I think he watches too much TV.
