Ah, the joys of puppy-hood: smooth bellies, romping in the yard, happy wagging tails... biting, jumping, messing on the floor, and chewing everything.

<a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/08-August/Kozmo2/JPEG/20050807_001.jpg"><img src="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/08-August/Kozmo2/JPEG/.cache/100x66-20050807_001.jpg" width="100" height="66" alt="Josh carrying Kozmo" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="10" align="right" /></a>Tonight Josh lost his temper with Kozmo. This isn't the first time, and I'm sure it won't be his last.  Josh was trying to watch TV (in the floor), and Kozmo wanted to play.  One nip on sensitive skin too many and Josh was pretty upset.  I don't want to make light of this.  Those puppy teeth are razor sharp.  Kozmo certainly hasn't learned his "bite inhibition" either.  It's hard work raising a puppy.

Josh said some pretty drastic things like, "I want to take him back where we got him!" and "I don't want him any more."  Justin was pretty taken aback by this.  He certainly didn't want to loose Kozmo.

Justin worried, "I'll miss Kozmo.  Then we won't have a dog anymore."  It's nice to see honest emotion in kids.  Justin doesn't have any guile in him and couldn't mask his emotions even if it occurred to him.  Josh is fairly guileless too, but can certainly have a mean streak.

My blog serves several purposes.  Hopefully from time to time it's enlightening.  Other times it's informative.  Sometimes though it's just a record.  It's a place to jot down memories I don't want to forget.  I hope that one day my kids will read back through all this and get a glimpse through a different perspective on this time.  Tonight's episode was so emotionally charged, I just had to write it down.

I should add that by the end of the evening, Josh was back to petting on Kozmo and generally acting his usual affectionate self.
