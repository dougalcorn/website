If you're actually reading my blog (versus some planet or an RSS feed), you've no doubt noticed my new look.  I had a post about switching from "blosxom":http://blosxom.com to "Typo":http://typo.leetsoft.com/.  Somewhere in my upgrades I think I deleted that post.  So, I just wanted to enter another post identifying my blog with Typo.  According to Justin Palmer, "typo 2.5 is almost ready":http://www.encytemedia.com/article/48/typo-25-previews.  Lots of neat stuff.  By the way, if you don't know, typo is "Ruby on Rails":http://rubyonrails.com powered!
