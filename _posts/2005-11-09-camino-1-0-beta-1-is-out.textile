I'd like to give props to the "Camino Browser Community":http://www.caminobrowser.org/ for "releasing Camino 1.0 beta 1":http://www.caminobrowser.org/community/2005/11/camino-10-beta-1-is-out.html.  I've been a Camino user since the early 0.8 days.  I prefer it for several reasons.  Overall, it feels more like a Mac app than "Firefox":http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ does.  I think Camino's tabs are much nicer.  Also, keyboard navigation is nicer in Camino than even Safari.  Give it a try!

<blockquote>We've just released <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/download/releases/1b1/">Camino 1.0 beta 1</a>.

This is by far the finest Camino release ever. It's so great, we're calling it our stable release and replacing the download link on the main page with it.

Check out the <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/releases/10b1.html">release notes</a> for more information on what's changed.
