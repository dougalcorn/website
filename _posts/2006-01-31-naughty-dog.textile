My "wife":http://carla.lathi.net/ is taking my "dog":http://blog.lathi.net/articles/search?q=kozmo to obedience school.  This is her account of their "first night of class":http://carla.lathi.net/articles/2006/01/30/dog-school.  Truly funny stuff.

Over Christmas holidays, Carla and I listened to "Marley and Me: Live and Love with the World's Worst Dog":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006083398X/sr=1-1/qid=1138719269/.  While I don't really believe Kozmo is the "World's Worst Dog", there was a lot of things from that book that rang true.  In the book, John Grogan says he and his dog Marley are the only ones he knows that have been expelled from obedience school.  I asked Carla if the teacher had kicked them out of class on the first night.  She said no, but Kozmo is probably the dog with the most energy in the class (how's that for a euphemism?).
