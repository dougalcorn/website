We try to keep our weekends fairly relaxing.  Most of our hurrying and tight scheduled stuff is during the week.  For instance, our goals for this weekend are to: 1) Take down our Christmas Tree (!); 2) Empty all the stuff out of my old desk so we can get it ready to give away; 3) Take our guest bed out of Tiffany's room to get ready for her "big girl bed".
<p />
So, Carla and I slept in today.  I took my time getting ready this morning and did fun things like clip my hair.  We watched some cartoons with the kids, played a little Game Cube too.  Carla had removed all the decorations from the Christmas Tree on Friday.  I took down all the lights and took down the tree.  The one stressful thing I did today was make the kids pick up the living room and dining room.  I just don't know how to get them to pick up their stuff without resorting to tactics I hate using.  Once, the living room was clean I wrestled with the kids for a while.  
<p />
After lunch I took the boys out hiking.  We went down by the Little Miami river again.  We were supposed to get pretty bad weather today.  Instead we mainly got intermittent snow and rain.  It wasn't too cold though.  I bundled the boys up as if we were going sledding.  We hiked for about an hour and a half.  Justin was too pooped to do the walking back.  I literally carried him on my shoulders for about half the return trip.
<p />
When we got home, I fixed some hot chocolate for Justin (Josh doesn't like it; he just ate the marsh mellows instead).  After Tiffany woke up from her nap, I cuddled with her for a bit and watched "Dora the Explorer" until dinner was ready.  After dinner we played some "hide and seek" before bed.
<p />
Funny hide and seek story...  It was Josh's turn to count and I helped the kids hide.  I put Justin in his closet and Tiffy and I hid in my closet.  Josh found us first and started looking for Justin.  The first kid found had been doing this, "I know where such-and-such is," and then leading the seeker to the hider.  So Josh finds Tiffany and I and starts to head into his room to find Justin.  Tiffy says, "I know where Justin is.  He's downstairs."  She proceeds to lead Josh downstairs to the basement where she "knows" Justin is hiding.  Writing this doesn't seem that funny, but I got a good chuckle watching my three year old daughter lead my seven year old son on a wild goose chase.

We got some things done, but mainly just hung out with the kids.  We had talked about doing some shopping today, but the weather scared us off.  We couldn't tell when the storm was supposed to hit and didn't want to get caught out in it.  So, we just stayed home instead.  Turns out that was a pretty good idea.

UPDATE: Here's a candid photo Carla took of the kids and I "wrestling".  What we're really doing is "squishing" Josh.  Follow the link to the <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/01-January/2005-01-29_2.JPG">larger photograph</a> for more comments.
