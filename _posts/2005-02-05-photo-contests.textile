One of my goals for this year is to win an on-line photography contest.  There are a couple sites I've been following: <a href="http://dpchallenge.com" target="_top">dpchallenge</a>, <a href="http://fredmiranda.com" target="_top">Fred Miranda</a>, <a href="http://worth1000.com" target="_top">Worth 1000</a>.  The contests are intimidating.  All of the photos are very, very good.  The challenge topics are vague.  I see the challenge and don't know what to do.

I found this forum post titled <a href="http://dpchallenge.com/forum.php?action=read&#38;FORUM_THREAD_ID=156130" target="_top">Win a Ribbon!</a>  First, it starts with the assumption that you know how to take a technically good photo.  The real problem is what to photograph.  This post is a good description of what separates an average photo from a prize winning photo.

For me, a life-long engineer, it's hard to think right-brained.  That's a lot of what this photography hobby is about: stretching my artistic and creative side.  So, stuff like this post is good for me.
