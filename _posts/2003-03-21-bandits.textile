Oh, I watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0219965" target="_top">Bandits</a> the other night on showtime.  The first time I saw it, I thought it was pretty funny.  <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Thornton,%20Billy%20Bob" target="_top">Billy Bob Thornton</a> is very funny as a nerdy hypochondriac.  This time I saw it, I wasn't nearly as entertained.  I was more distracted by the moral message of the the film.
