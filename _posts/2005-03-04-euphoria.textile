Last night Carla and I went out to dinner for some time together.  We went down to the Cheesecake Factory in Kenwood Mall.  Besides great cheesecake, there's an Apple Store just a short walk in the same mall!

Of course we went in.  My eyes were immediately drawn to the gargantuan <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/" target="_top">30" Cinema Display</a>.  This is the most amazing monitor I've ever seen.  Of course, I said the same thing about my own 20" Cinema Display just a few months ago.  I really couldn't believe how big 30" is.  I knew it was big.  I had seen pictures of it on Apple's site.  But I wasn't prepared for just how big it is.  Standing in front of it is totally immersive.  It is big enough to cover most of your peripheral vision.  You literally have to turn your head to see from one side to the other.  The sales kid opened up a newsletter in MS-Word.  He put up 6 pages (3 across by 2 down) at 100% and you could easily read every word!  Simply amazing.
