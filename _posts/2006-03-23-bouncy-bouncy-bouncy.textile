From a suggestion on "#caboose":http://caboo.se/ I've snagged my wife's 65cm exercise ball as my desk chair.  I sit at my desk _a lot_ and struggle with poor posture and general lower back pain.

The ball is quite fun.  I'm such a fidgety person, I can't stop bouncing!  If you want to setup an iChat video you can see me bounce.  I'm definitely sitting up straight.  After a little over six hours on it yesterday, my back is definitely feeling sore.  Not aching like I'm out of position sore; but sore like my muscles are feeling the exercise.

I've still got my regular desk chair, but when I sit in it I immediately start to slouch.  After a few minutes I get pretty aggravated when the casters start to make ruts in the chair matt and I have to keep scooting to re-adjust my position.  I'm really liking the ball!
