My first words after the movie was over: "That was Totally Awesome!"  Not very long after that I said, "George Lucas should be ashamed of himeself."

This is the "back story" to all the other Batman films.  It's a back story done right.  Everything is totally believable in a movie kind of way.  I thought the story was pretty original but still mostly consistent with the overall Batman story.  The script (and there is a script -- as opposed to the Lucas films) is quite good.  The directing is top notch.  The acting is superb.  Nothing is overdone.  It's not showy; just a great movie.  There is a lot of "star power" in this: Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, and also the two main characters <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000288/" target="_top">Christian Bale</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0005017/" target="_top">Katie Holmes</a>.  All of them do a good job.  None of the overpower the others.  They just play their part.  I think that's a credit to the director, <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0634240/" target="_top">Christopher Nolan</a> (who also did one of my other favorite films, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0209144/" target="_top">Momento</a>).

There are definitely some frightening scenes.  Josh won't see this movie for several more years.  But if you're over 13 or so, I can't recommend this movie enough.  It's a great blockbuster film.  If only more of our action/comic book movies could be like this one.
