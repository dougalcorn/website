For those of you who don't know, Piers writes the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/at/16" target="_top">weekly Perl 6 Summaries</a>.  He gives the book high marks.  His review itself is a pretty good one or two page summary of Perl 6.  There were a couple of good links in his review.  One is the site of <a href="http://perl.plover.com/" target="_top">Mark Jason Dominus</a>.  Piers says, "if you don't listen to Mark, you really should."  He goes on to point out the "importance [Mark] places on Perl's high level capabilities, particularly its functional programming capabilities."  I'm a big fan of functional programming.  I went over to Mark's site and found piles and piles of good writing.  Of course, I noticed this excellent description of <a href="http://www.plover.com/~mjd/amazon.html" target="_top">why Mark Jason Dominus is boycotting Amazon</a>.  The other interesting link was to <a href="http://lambda.weblogs.com/" target="_top">Lambda the Ultimate</a>.  Being a Lisp fan, I find that title interesting all by itself.  Turns out the site is a weblog "dedicated to the study of programming languages."  BTW, I'd like to verbally give reference to the funny and well done cover art for the <a href="http://bleaklow.com/blog/archive/000018.html" target="_top">"New Perl 6 Book Announced"</a>
