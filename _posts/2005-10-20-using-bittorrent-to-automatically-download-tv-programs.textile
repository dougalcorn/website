I haven't looked into the details of this "Hack a Day":http://www.hackaday.com/ article on "How-To Automatically download and convert TV for your iPod":http://www.hackaday.com/entry/1234000100064041/, but I'm very interested in the topic.  Throwing quickies like this into my blog seems like a good way to "remember" pages like this.

I don't have (and probably won't for quite a while) an iPod Video; however, I'm traveling a lot right now and would like to be able to download TV to my Mac.  The idea isn't new to me, but I've thought for a while that BitTorrent could make a pretty good backend for a PVR.

These are interesting times!

BTW, I found this link from "The Unofficial Apple Weblog":http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/20/automatically-download-and-convert-shows-for-your-ipod/
