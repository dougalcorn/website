It looks like we're moving.  I had a really good review with my bosses last week in Florida.  The one thing they made clear: "We want you in Cleveland."  The only real outstanding issue is how much they are willing to pay to make that happen.  We talked some preliminary numbers that seemed in the right ball park.  I'll know more on Monday what they'll be willing to do.

So Carla and I have been talking about this since Thursday.  Tonight I put together a list of <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/HousesInKingsSchools">HousesInKingsSchools</a> just to see what our competition would be.  Josh overhears us talking buying/selling houses and asks if we're going to sell our house.  When I say that we are going to sell our house and move he asks, "Are we going to move into another house in Cincinnati or move close to your work?"  He's so smart.  When we tell him we're going to move to Cleveland, close to my work, he get's very excited.  "Now you can go to work a short time instead of going to work for a long, long time!"  Maybe I should have done this a long time ago.
