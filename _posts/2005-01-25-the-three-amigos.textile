I'm thankful that my kids get along.  My oldest, Josh, is seven; Justin is four; and Tiffany just turned three.  It's been said more than one time that Justin is Josh's shadow.  The two of them get along very well.  Justin and Tiffany get along really well too.  Last night I was reminded of Joshua and Tiffany's relationship.<a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2004/12-December/Christmas%20Portraits/2004-12-10_202900.JPG"><img src="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2004/12-December/Christmas%20Portraits/.cache/60x75-2004-12-10_202900.JPG" width="60" height="75" alt="My Three Kids" align="right" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="10" /></a>

My parents had been visiting for several days end of last week and weekend.  Our "guest bed" is actually in Tiffany's room.  When we have guests, she gets displaced.  She's still sleeping in a crib and this time we put a Pack-n-Play in the boys room for her to sleep in.  The Pack-n-Play went over with mixed success.  Tiffany is really old enough to sleep in a regular bed.  We'll probably switch her over sooner rather than later.  Anyway, she pretty much ended up climbing out of the Pack-n-Play and sleeping in bed with Justin.

I'm finally getting to the point of this story.  Last night I put the kids to bed.  I had sent them up to brush their teeth and get dressed.  That usually ends up with some play time as they have more than a couple minutes unsupervised.  When I had decided it had gone on long enough, I headed upstairs to finish the "going to bed" routine.  As I was collecting Tiffany to take to her room Josh asks, "Can Tiffany sleep with us again?"  I was immediately touched that Josh had enjoyed Tiffany sleeping in his room to ask.  I still said no.  Maybe I should have gone ahead and said yes.  Anyway, I'm glad my kids get along.
