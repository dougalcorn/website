I listen to "Escape Pod":http://www.escapepod.org/ regularly.  It's well written and well read Science Fiction that fits in 30 - 45 minutes.  The Episode 27 is "Iron Bars and Glass Jaw":http://www.escapepod.org/2005/11/10/ep027-iron-bars-and-the-glass-jaw/

You and your brethren are integral to the fabric of society. We of The Union are grateful for your hard work and courage." I can rattle that sort of crap off all day long.

This is a great story by Jeffrey R. DeRego about what our society might be like if there really were super heros.  Not the glamor of somebody swooping in to save the day; but, the infrastructure of how the whole setup would have to work.

Oh, and the reader, Jonathon Sullivan, is simply fantastic.  I can't imagine this story read any better.  It's definitely worth 35 minutes and 43 seconds.
