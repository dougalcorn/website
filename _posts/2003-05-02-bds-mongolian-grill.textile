I'm getting quite spoiled by the restaurants here.  I guess there are more than a few bd's around the country.  Basically you buy a bowl of "stuff."  They have three stages of salad bar type arrangements.  The first is raw veggies of more than a few varieties.  The second is an equal selection of uncooked meat.  The third is a yet again large selection of sauces.  The idea is that you basically mix up your own fix'ns.  You decide what veggies, meat and sauce you want and then take it to the grill.  Their grill is like a very large wheel.  It's about five to six feet in diameter.  You stand around this grill and the cooks put your food down on the grill.  Each person gets their own little slice of the wheel where their food is cooked.  I think this is like "U R Cooks" done right.  I never liked the idea of going out to eat and then having to cook my food.  This place let's you still choose what you want (with much more variety) but they cook it for you.  It was quite fun.
