I have been taking two photography classes this term: Available Light Photography, and the Psychology of Color.  I've enjoyed them both a great deal.  It's been worth it for no other reason than I have a shooting assignment each week and the pressure to produce something worth showing to the class.  I've also made some friends in the artist community.  I enjoyed being exposed to true artist and their way of thinking and seeing.  Technically, I don't think my work has improved much.  Artistically, I think my photos are much better now than 9 weeks ago.  I've loaded up all of my photos for both <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/Classes/" target="_top">classes</a>.  Of particular note, is the <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/Classes/Available%20Light%20Portraiture/Best%20Of/" target="_top">best of portraiture</a> and <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/Classes/Psychology%20of%20Color/Best%20of/" target="_top">best of color</a>.
