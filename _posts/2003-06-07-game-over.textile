Last weekend Josh and I made it to the final boss in Legeng of Zelda: Wind Waker.  He was very hard and I died fairly quickly.  I made a point to not save my game so I could try again later.  This weekend while I was in Cleveland Josh thought he'd take a try at the final boss.  Of course, he died too.  The difference is he saved the game after he died.  Carla had specifically told him not to.  He deliberately disobeyed and saved the game.  That's a little distressing, but I thought I could still possibly get another crack at the conclusion to the game without having to start all over.  Today we're cleaning up all the toys and stuff from the living room and I was picking up the <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/GameCube">GameCube</a> game cases and putting the away.  I noticed the Zelda case was empty.  When I asked Josh about it, he said he didn't know where the game disk was.  Turns out someone lost the disk this week.  Of course, when I say "someone" the answer is really Justin.  I was angry, but there was nothing I could do about it.  I tried to find the disk for a little while to no avail.  I repeated my stern warning to Justin not to "play" with the <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/GameCube">GameCube</a> disks (I'm afraid that was to no avail too).  I know the disk is in the house somewhere.  Maybe we'll find it when we move.
