Just wanted to say that Princess is doing fine.  It took her a few days before she was ready to eat regularly.  Now she's eating pretty well and hobbling about.  She won't jump or really run.  When she walks, she puts weight on her healing leg.  Sometimes she walks fast and just lifts it.  She's supposed to get her stitches out sometime this week.  I'll update again later.
