This morning Carla picked out clothes for all three kids as she usually does.  She was just telling me this story of getting Justin dressed.  She said that when she put the clothes on Justin he threw this huge fit.  He started yelling, "Nooo!!! Me not wear!!!".  He repeated that mantra over an over a little bit louder until he was in a screaming, crying crescendo.  So, Carla had to take the clothes off and find something else for him to wear.
<p />
"What clothes did you originally have picked out for him," I asked.
<p />
"A one-piece, snap-in-the-crotch, onesy."
