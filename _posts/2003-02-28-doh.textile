I forgot to set an alarm to go pick up Josh from pre-school.  Of course, that means I was <em>way</em> late picking him up; like 40 minutes late.  I would have just kept right on working except the school called me!  I'm so embarassed I forgot. <img alt="whatever" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/indifferent.gif" />
