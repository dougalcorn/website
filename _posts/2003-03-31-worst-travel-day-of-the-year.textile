Five hours to drive in from Cincinnati to Cleveland.  There was a light dusting of snow most of the way from Columbus to Cleveland.  The problem is that few had put out any salt.  The Interstate was just a big sheet of ice.  I lost count how many cars I saw in the ditch.  I think I saw five vehicles actually flipped over including one dump-truck.  That truck's load of sand or gravel was spilled in the media.  Once we were down to one lane passing a flipped SUV by driving on the left-hand shoulder.  I heard on the radio that shortly after I got through downtown Columbus that they had closed I-71N due to an accident.  If I had been 10 or 15 minutes slower I would have been stuck.

Anyway, I'm working from Cleveland this week.
