So Carla's been trying to go to the library all day.  She told the kids she would take them and Josh has been very excited.  For whatever reason, Carla's internal clock has been off by a couple of hours all day.  It's a little before seven o'clock and she realizes what time it is.  We're eating dinner and she tells Josh that we'll have to go to the Library tomorrow because the Library closes at seven.  Josh starts crying.  Of course, Justin doesn't really understand what's just happened.  All he knows is he's been sitting eating dinner happily, Mom said something to Josh, and Josh starts crying.  Justin get's his angry eyes out and starts in on Carla, "Mommy, Stop it! Bblle essellde ffrellds Josh blla twooodle cry gruddlle!"  He then turns to Josh, "What happened?  What happened?  Josh, what happened?"  Turns back to Carla, "Bla tra unndle Josh hhrenna crying!"  Meanwhile Carla and I are doing are best not to laugh.  I had Carla call the library to find out when they closed.  Luckily, they close at 8:00 instead of 7:00.  So, all's well that ends well.
