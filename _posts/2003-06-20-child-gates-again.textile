I don't exactly remember when we quit putting the child gates up; it just kinda happened.  Tiffany hasn't been that interested in the stairs.  Well, we found her at the top of the stairs this morning trying to make her wobbly way down.  So, back up go the gates.  I think we'll take them back down once she can walk a straight line. ;-).
