At first the doctors wanted to put a stitch in it.  Due to the swelling they decided against it.  There was a dentist who also looked at her teeth and gave her the "okie dokie".  So it seems like her Birthday photos will be the only real casualty out of this. <img alt="smile" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/smile.gif" />
