One of our dear friends recently told us they were pregnant with their first baby! (Sorry I can't reveal who it is just yet; I'll update later when they say it's OK.)  The soon-to-be-father was looking at buying their first video camera.  I was lamenting that I didn't think we had taken enough video.  We seem to only get special events like birthdays and Christmas (which for us happen almost at the same time) and not get enough everyday events.  Once a year we pull all of our video off the 8mm tapes and record them onto VHS.  Even with footage that is only a year old, it is neat to remember how our kids once were.
<p />
With that in mind, I was quite surprised when Joshua told me he knew how to make peanut butter sandwiches.  So, I whipped out the video camera to record him making the sandwiches: one for his brother Justin and one for himself.  I wish I could post a link here to the video clip!  It was great video.  The two of them were sitting on bar stools at the kitchen island.  Josh was making the sandwiches and Justin was thoroughly enjoying his.  They were so cute.  I know that's some footage we'll enjoy in a few years.  Next time you stop by our house ask about that video and I'll be glad to share it!
