He claims it became loose after he got the web from a Spiderman toy stuck in his teeth and pulled it out.  Here's his full story:
<p />
<blockquote><i>
I got a toy Spderman stuck in my tooth and I pulled it out.  It hurt when it came out.  Then I went to the bathroom to look in the mirror and see if it was really loose.  I knew it was really loose because my tongue was getting through it.
</i></blockquote>

It was quite freakish when he showed it to me.  He's been wanting a loose tooth for a long time since a lot of his friends have lost a tooth or two.  I wasn't really expecting it to be loose.  He says, "See?"  Then wiggles it with his tongue obscuring the tooth from me.  So I stick my finger on it and give it a little wiggle.  It's really loose!  Not like loose it at dinner tonight loose; but, definitely loose.
<p />
Here's some other things he's said about it or asked about it:
<ul>
<li>"I'm excited about my tooth being loose."</li>
<li>"Will this tooth grow back onto my mouth?"</li>
<li>"What will the dentist give me if I have a loose tooth?"</li>
<li>"Will the tooth fairy give me anything for a loose tooth?"</li>
<li>"I have <em>baby</em> teeth?"</li>
</ul>
