It was thirteen years ago today that Carla and I were married.  Happy Anniversary, Baby!  In these times it's easy to quit when the going gets tough.  I'm so happy she's stuck with me all this time.  Carla has blessed my life in many ways.  I'm thankful for her companionship, her radically different perspective, her humor, and the trust we share.  I love you.  I hope I can make all your sacrifices and perseverance worthwhile.
