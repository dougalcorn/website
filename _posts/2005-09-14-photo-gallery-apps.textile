I'd like to get a peek at all the folks working on  photo gallery apps in Rails.  Mail messages show up on the mailing list fairly frequently related to image handling and cataloging.  I also see comments about it on IRC as well.  What I don't see is anything closed to finished and available as free software.

I'm very interested in DAM(Digital Asset Management).  I don't want a "Flickr Killer", but just something for me to self-host, manage _all_ my photos, and still make it easy and enjoyable for friends and family to browse.

I've started a "Photo App":http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/PhotoApp on the Rails wiki where I hope to at least get a list of folks who are willing to admit they are working on a photo gallery, are willing to share their code, and are willing to accept help from others.
