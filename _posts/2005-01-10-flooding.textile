I guess it's the worst since '97.  A kid died today in the floods.  He had driven on a closed road and his car was swept away.  The kid was able to help save the other passenger in the car, but drowned himself.  That' the only fatality that's been attributed to this flood.

Our house is in no danger even though we are <a href="http://lathi.net/gallery/hiking" target="_top">close to the Little Miami River</a>.  The banks are quite steep here.  I bet we're about as far above the river as we are far from it.
