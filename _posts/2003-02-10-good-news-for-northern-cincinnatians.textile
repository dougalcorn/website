There's a new Chineese restaurant called "China Buffet" on Mason-Montgomery Road in the same building as Chipotle.  Boy, am I excited.  Carla, the kids and I ate lunch there yesterday afternoon.  We got out for about $25 (including tip).  They had a great selection!  There was about five different soups, at least a dozen different entrees, lots of fresh fruit, salad fix'ns, and even some sushi!  This makes me miss the old Hunan's in Oklahoma City much less.
