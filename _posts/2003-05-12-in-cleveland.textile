So, it's cold and rainy here.  Does winter never end?  I'm in the office catching up with my boss watching it rain outside.  Out of the corner of my eye I see through our side window white flakes falling heavily.  Of course, I freak out shortly before I realize it's just blossoms off the cherry tree.
