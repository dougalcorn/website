Carla is gearing up for her fourth year to organize VBS at our church.  It's a big deal and she does a great job.  Last night she had her first planning meeting for all the people who are going to be involved with planning and preparation.  Since this was at our house, my job was to keep the kids out of sight and out of mind.  Well, a couple other parents brought their kids too.  I ended up with seven there all running wild.  Luckily my friend Mark also came.
<p />
Just this last weekend I offered a standing invitation to him to come out to our house.  Mark's an avid fisherman.  I had thought it'd be fun to fish in the Little Miami river near my house.  Our kids would get a big kick out of it.
<p />
So Mark comes over last night ready to fish.  What would have been a very trying evening turned into a very pleasant evening and a successful kid event!  For the most part, Mark managed the fishing poles and I <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/06-June/Fishing%20at%20the%20Little%20Miami/JPEG/" target="_top">shot photos</a>.

Josh actually caught the first fish.  We were using worms on a hook with a bobber.  Mark had just raised the bobber so the hook would sink further and the next cast snagged a little one pound catfish.  Mark caught a shad and let Tiffany reel it in.  She liked doing that, but didn't want anything to do with the fish once it came out of the water.  The boys had fun catching crawdads and toads as well.

He's the one still casting and reeling when all the other kids are bored and off playing.  It's fun to watch your kids really take to stuff.  That's why I've selected this photo as the "<a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/06-June/Fishing%20at%20the%20Little%20Miami/JPEG/20050609_fishing_060.jpg" target="_top">Best of the Evening</a>".
