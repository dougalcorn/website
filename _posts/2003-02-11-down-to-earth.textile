I watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0231775" target="_top">"Down to Earth"</a> staring <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Rock,%20Chris" target="_top">Chris Rock</a> on Showtime last night in the hotel.  It's a mildly funny version of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0077663" target="_top">"Heaven Can Wait"</a> staring <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Beatty,%20Warren" target="_top">Warren Beatty</a>.  Of course, the original was only mildly funny too.  Chris Rock's version is OK.  It is surprisingly clean being Chris Rock; although there is some foul language and sexual content.  I only watched it because it was on.  Don't really recommend it.
