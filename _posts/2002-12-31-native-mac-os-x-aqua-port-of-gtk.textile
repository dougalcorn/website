And now for the news of the day: The <a href="http://www.gtk.org" target="_top">GTK+</a>
widget library has an alpha port to Mac OS X using the native Aqua
graphical interface.  What this means is that the hundres or thousands
of GTK+ apps written for X-Windows will be much easier to port and run
natively on Mac OS X.  Anyway, one less stumbling block to
