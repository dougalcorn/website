Last fall I bought a "dwarf magnolia" tree at Natrop's fall sale for $25.  I dug a nice big hole for it and dug out all the rocks and such.  I filled it with nice dirt and planted my tree.  This spring it hasn't looked very healthy.  The leaves aren't a very rich, dark green.  They're kindof yellow-ish.  I've been worried about it, but not worried enough to actually take action.  Today Carla pointed out a giant flower bud on it!  I could see the bud about to bloom out all the way from the back door of the house.  I was so excited, I had to walk out there to see it.  There were several other buds ready to bloom too!  I'm so glad the tree has survived.
