After some friends came over for dinner, Carla and I decided to go ahead and rent a movie.  Due to that late hour on Saturday night there wasn't much to choose from.  I was looking for something Carla would enjoy, so I ended up with "Tomorrow Never Dies".  Before you start laughing, Carla is a pretty big James Bond fan.  Actually, she's a Pierce Brosnen fan.  So, she really did enjoy watching this.  I was pleasently amused as well.
