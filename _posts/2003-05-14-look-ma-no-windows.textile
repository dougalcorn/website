I simply make sure they conform to the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/upgrade/" target="_top">web standards</a>, look nice in <a href="http://mozilla.org/" target="_top">mozilla</a>, and go about my merry way.  However, on the occations that I do sites that require a high degree of aestetic pleasantness my clients often complain about how the finished site looks in Internet Explorer.  I don't want to reboot just to look at a web page.  I didn't really want to spend the $300 on <a href="http://vmware.com" target="_top">vmware</a> and then more money on a valid MS-Windows license.  I ended up downloading the demo for the <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/office/" target="_top">Crossover Office</a> from <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/home/" target="_top">Code Weavers</a>.  This is a slick product.  It was pretty easy to setup and get IE 6 installed.  The funny part was when the IE installer asked me to reboot my computer.  I've uploaded a <a href="http://www.lathi.net/images/crossover-office.jpg" target="_top">screen-shot</a> of my desktop showing emacs, mozilla, and IE.  Be warned, my desktop is 1600x1200.
