A buddy of mine forwarded a link to this School House Rock <a href="http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/research/recording_head/pr/PerpendicularAnimation.html" target="_top">spoof</a> explaining Hitachi's new perpendicular storage technologies.  While I had heard about perpendicular storage and thought, "Hmm, that's different," I never thought much about it after that.  This funny little flash animation made me laugh though.  I guess they paid to have this done just for that reason.  Something to push the technology into the limelight with average folks like me.
