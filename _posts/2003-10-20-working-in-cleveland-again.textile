I got about 1/3 of the way into work this morning (that's a little over an hour drive) and stopped for a coffee refill (this is at about 6:30am).  It was then that I realized I had left my wallet at home in Cincinnati.  So, I'm in to work fairly late today. <img alt="frown" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/frown.gif" />
