I'd like to announce some improvements to "Storycards":http://lathi.net/storycards:

* Use Textile to format stories
* Cards now Acts as a List -- this means you can prioritize the cards
* Drastic improvement to the layout and usability of nearly all the views
* Improved versioning of the cards by only bumping revision when we need to
* Supports multiple projects that have separate cards

I'd like some more eyes on this.  There are quite a few changes that I've been making up off the top of my head.  I'm up to 133 lines of code with 267 lines of test.  I think this version is actually useable.
