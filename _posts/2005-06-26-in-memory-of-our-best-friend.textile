Princess was the greatest dog ever.  She was sweet and affectionate; loving and considerate.  She always knew who needed her attention the most.  When you were sick or sad, she'd come cuddle with you.  When the kids were upset, she'd go sit with them.  For 12 years she was our friend.  She was one of the closest companions I've had.  When I worked from home, she always hung out with me in the office.
<p />
Friday morning we had her put to sleep.  She was suffering from <a href="http://www.upei.ca/~cidd/Diseases/musculoskeletal/intervertebraldiskdisease.htm" target="_top">Invertebral Disk Disease</a>.  I'm not exactly sure how what happened.  I don't know if she had some injury that exacerbated a growing problem, if it just gradually got worse until we finally noticed, or some combination.  For the most part she always acted young.  We called her "Puppy" as often as we called her by name.  For two weeks we were well aware of her discomfort and pain.  The vet told us it might go away with strict rest.  Carla was out of town and I didn't force her to rest as much.  I tried to keep her confined.  She seemed better and was trying to do more than she should have: she went up and down the stairs a couple times and jumped on the couch a couple times.
<p />
It was a terrible decision to have her put to sleep.  I'm still reeling from it.  I can't remember the last time, but Thursday night and Friday I cried several times.  I just couldn't stand the thought of loosing her.  Carla and I both went to the vet.  We had a sitter come stay with the kids.  Afterwards we didn't want to go home, so we just drove around for a while.
<p />
Some of our best friends had invited us to spend the weekend with them at their lake house.  Neither Carla nor myself wanted to stay home.  So we went.  It was a good weekend, but I'm still feeling off center.  The kids are mostly unaware.  Josh was pretty sad when I told him.  I think it upset him more that I was so sad than anything else.
<p />
We're home from the lake now.  It's sad being here without Princess following me around.  Carla has "cleaned house" of all Princess' things.  The visual reminders make it harder.
<p />
Josh and Justin are anxious to talk about getting another dog.  In a way, I think Carla and I are anxious to get another dog too.  Having a house without a dog makes Princess' absence worse.  I'm not sure what we'll do.  I know we'll get another dog.  I'm just not sure when.
