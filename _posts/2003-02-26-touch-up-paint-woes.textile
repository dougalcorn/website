title: Touch Up Paint Woes

So we're trying to get the house ready to sell.  When we bought the house we were given a "Touch Up Kit" that included the paints needed.  Unfortunately when I went to get the wall paint can was terribly ruined.  Classic case of failure to clean up properly.  The result was two things.  First, after Carla had done touch up painting for most of the dinning room we realized it was drying darker than the rest of the wall.  That means our dinning room was roughly poka-dotted.  The lid had not been secured properly and it was all rusted inside.  In retrospect, it should have been obvious that the paint wouldn't be the same color.  The second problem was that the can had so much paint and rust on the outside we couldn't tell <em>exactly</em> what kind of paint it was.  We were able to tell that it was Sherman William's flat "City Loft", but not the grade.  While I was at the Sherman William's store the guy there was able to look up and see that recently our builder had bought of flat paint of grade X.  I pay $25 for a gallon of "City Loft" flat in grade X, come home, and re-touch all the spots where Carla had touched earlier.  It looks great!  What a match!  So, we proceed to finish touching up all the walls downstairs.  After we finished, we watched a movie.  After the movie we went to inspect our handy work.  It becomes obvious to me that grade X was the wrong grade.  We should have gotten grade Y.  When you look at the walls dead on, it looks fine.  The color is right.  When you look at the walls from an angle, you can clearly see the difference between where we painted and where we didn't.

I'm not exactly sure how to fix this. The painting is certainly less than optimal.  I feel like the "right thing to do" would be to take this new paint and paint all of the walls downstairs; just take a roller and put a single coat of paint on everything.  Of course, that's a lot of work and definitely more than one gallon of paint.  The flip side is that whoever buys the house will probably paint over it anyway.  Since it probably looks good enough to show, maybe we should just leave it to them to paint it with the colors they want.  I can see where this is going.  It looks like I have a lot of painting left to do this week. <img alt="whatever" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/indifferent.gif" />
