I bought a pair of head-phones on the way to work Monday morning.  When I got to work I borrowed a utility knife from our service guy to open the packaging.  I cut the cable for the head-phones.  This morning while grinding coffee the cover came off the grinder and semi-ground coffee went all over the office.  I knocked over a coffee up on my desk with soapy water.  At lunch I spilled soy/wasabi sauce on my pants.  My boss actually asked me if I was OK.  No, I'm not on drugs.

This actually goes to show that biorythm stuff is bunk.  I have a little <a href="http://wmbio.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">dock app</a> that shows the state of your three primary biorythms.  Theoretically everyone's body works in specific cycles with respect to your physicallity, emotion, and intellect.  The rythms of the three are slightly out of sync.  The idea is that when your intellect is at it's peak is when you should be doing your best work, etc.  Anyway, right now my physical cycle is supposed to be just after it's peak.  That's the reason I had this biorythm chart up.  I wanted to experientially see what types of correlation there would be.  Basically none.  I guess now that I've come to that firm conclusion I'll remove that app from my startup. <img alt="wink" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/wink.gif" />
