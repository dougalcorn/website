The bus route I take is a direct commuter route from suburbia to downtown and back.  Pretty much everyone on the bus is just like me: mid- to older, average, overweight, khaki slacks, button down shirt; stereo-typical middle-class corporate weenies.  Every once and a while you get an odd duck on the bus though.  Friday after noon I had an honest to goodness beatnik sitting across from me.  If you've seen the animated film "Iron Giant", this guy looks exactly like the beatnik that befriends the boy and helps protect the giant.  I managed to surreptitiously get this snap-shot with my camera phone.

He looks a little older than me, but jet black hair and maybe some "grecian formula".  It's just a tad long, wavy, a little disheveled, but definitely a $50 hair cut.  You can't see it in this crappie photo, but he's got that whole "I don't really have a beard, but I can't be bothered to shave ever day" scruff.  Jeans and a black turtle-neck.  That book he's reading?  I kid you not: Albert Camus' <em>The Stranger</em>.

Seeing him on the bus I was wondering if they had added a stop for "Greenich Village".
