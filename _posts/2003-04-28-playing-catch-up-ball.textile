If you can't tell, I've been on the plane flying to Denver for the past two hours.  Actually, it hasn't been quite two hours.  My batter doesn't last that long.  After taking out my second hard drive and DVD drive I've managed to eak out about 1:45.  Anway, you should have been able to tell I was sitting idle by the amount of catch-up blogging I've been able to do and how voluminous my writing has been.  I'm just sitting here staring at the bulk-head dumping out what comes in my brain.  I also grabbed about 100MB of pictures off Carla's computer this morning before I left home.  Later on I'll upload some of that to my Wiki so you can finally see pictures of <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/TiffanysBirthday">TiffanysBirthday</a> and some <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><font color="#0000FF">EasterPictures</font></span><a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/edit/Main/EasterPictures?topicparent=Main.WebHome">?</a>.  I think I have some pictures of taking the kids to the <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><font color="#0000FF">NewportAquarium</font></span><a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/edit/Main/NewportAquarium?topicparent=Main.WebHome">?</a> too.
