<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0333766/"><img src="http://lathi.net/images/garden-state.jpg" height="138" width="100" align="right" border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Garden-State" title="" longdesc="" /></a>I watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0333766" target="_top">Garden State</a> tonight.  I was really excited about this movie because it's written and directed by <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0103785/" target="_top">Zach Braff</a>.  I've enjoyed him on <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0285403/" target="_top">"Scrubs"</a> when I've seen it.  I was expecting some of that same type humor and wit.  I think <em>Garden State</em> was witty, but it's definitely not the same type humor as "Scrubs".  I really enjoyed watching the interaction between Zach's character and his opposite, <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000204/" target="_top">Natalie Portman</a>.  I'm not sure I'd really recommend this film unless you're the kind of person that likes off-beat movies.
