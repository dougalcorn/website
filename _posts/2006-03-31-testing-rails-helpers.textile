I've asked "Scott":http://www.lunchboxsoftware.com/ four times now how write functional tests for helper methods.  He's replied the same all four times, and this time I'm going to "remember" it...

<typo:code lang="ruby">
require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../test_helper'
 
class HelperTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  include ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper
  include ActionView::Helpers::TagHelper
  include ApplicationHelper
  # include whatever helpers you want to test here, sometimes you'll need
  # to include some of the Rails helpers, as I've done above.
 
  def test_some_helper
  end
end
</typo:code>

By including the @ApplicationHelper@ in your test class, you have all the methods defined on that class available as local functions.  If you have helpers in other classes, you'd need to include those as well.
