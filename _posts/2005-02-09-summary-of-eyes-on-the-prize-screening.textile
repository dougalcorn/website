I participated in <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/EyesOnTheScreen">EyesOnTheScreen</a> last night.  Including my wife and I, there were seven of us.  I was a little disappointed in the turn out, but really appreciate my friends that showed.  Watching these videos has had a deep impact on me.  The material is astounding.  Assuming it's correct, I still find it unbelievable.  
<p />
First, looking back at it through the lens of Today it seems impossible that many of the things could possibly have happened.  How could the governor of Virginia decide it was better to close high schools and not educate their children than to allow black children to attend a white high school?  
<p />
Second, the whole thing freaks me out when looked at the the lens of my past.  The desegregation of schools in particular impacts me because I was somewhat involved in Louisiana.  Also, I'm familiar with similar issues.  The videos keep showing whites of the South saying things like, "This is our heritage."  I keep hearing the word "heritage" used to defend their actions.  Like it's OK to beat and kill blacks to save their "heritage".  Recently there's been a big bru-ha-ha over the state of South Carolina (where my parents live) flying the Confederate Battle Flag over the State Capital.  The defense of whites even now used the phrase "heritage not hate".  It's a catchy phrase, but the scene of whites waving the "bars and stars" and shouting "heritage" is just too much to shake.
<p />
Maybe I'm just hyper-sensitive to it, but I didn't feel the film was having the same impact on those there last night.  I don't know if I'm just more susceptible to moral outrage than the average joe.  I don't know if my own history makes me more susceptible to this particular moral outrage.  I don't know if they just needed time to processes it all.  Anyway you cut it, I guess I should be used to things that are important to me not being important to many other people.
<p />
Last night's turn out is my own fault though.  I didn't do near enough to advertise locally and in public channels.  Sadly <img alt="wink" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/wink.gif" /> I have to admit that not many Cincinnatians read my blog.  I have to conclude it's not an effective advertising tool to reach local people.
