After being gone a week and then not mowing on the weekend, my grass was quite tall.  So, I raised my mower a notch.  It still took me over an hour.  The humidity must be over 80%.  As "luck" would have it, this was the time to mow up the hill instead of across it.  It's supposed to storm all week.  Carla says she was awake last night because of a big thunderstorm.  I hope I get a chance to mow again soon to get the grass cut down to its normal level.
