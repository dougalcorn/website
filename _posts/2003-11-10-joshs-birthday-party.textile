It was a lot of fun.  He wanted "Bionicles" and Legos.  So, Carla made him a cake shaped like a very large Lego.  The party had some "Lego building time."  We dumped a big bucket of Legos on the table and I showed all the kids how to make a flower.  We then had a scavenger hunt where each location/clue had a piece to another Lego kit.  At the end of the hunt they had a policeman on a motorcycle built.  We also had the "old standby's": pin the tail on the donkey and bash the pinata.  I've uploaded some <a href="http://www.lathi.net/cgi-bin/ids/index.cgi?mode=album&amp;album=/2003/November/Josh%27s_Party" target="_top">pictures of the party</a>.  I've also loaded some cute pics of the kids while <a href="http://www.lathi.net/cgi-bin/ids/index.cgi?mode=album&amp;album=/2003/November/Grandparent%27s_Visit" target="_top">Grandma and Grandpa are here</a>.
