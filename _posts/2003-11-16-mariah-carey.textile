Mariah Carey's first album came out while I was still in college.  It was a fun album.  I was still living in an apartment with several other guys.  One of them bought this album.  We all thought it was great.  Of course, it didn't hurt that Mariah Carey was pretty to look at either.  Recently when I was down in FL I was flipping through the channels and saw a music video from this album.  It had been such a long time since I had heard any of her stuff.  It brought back lots of memories.  So, I did some poking around and found the album on <a href="http://half.com/" target="_top">Half.com</a> for $0.85 plus $2.50 for shipping.  Now that I'm listening to the album again, I still think it's ok.  There are several songs that hinted what was to come from her.  However, there are also several that are better than average.  All said and told, it's worth the $3.35 I paid for it.
