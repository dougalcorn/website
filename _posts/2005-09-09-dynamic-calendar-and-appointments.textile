One of my clients wants to allow her customers to book appointments through her web site.  I'm breaking this down into two parts: available time slots and actual appointments.  To get more "Web 2.0" pizzaz I'm also using "jscalendar":http://www.dynarch.com/projects/calendar/ from "Dynarch":http://dynarch.com.  The good news is: I don't have to wrestle with Time Zones!
