I'll go ahead and post this here too.  I originally <a href="http://carla.lathi.net/diary/Family/tiffy_s_busted_lip.html">posted</a> it over on <a href="http://carla.lathi.net/diary/">Carla's blog</a>.

When I got home from work tonight Carla was on the couch with Tiffy crying and blood all over. Tiffany had fallen off the table (don't ask) and bitten through her lower lip. Four ugly cuts on the inside of her lip with one of them all the way through.
<p />
After she had talked to our Pediatritian and a phone call to our dear friend that is also an ER Pediatritian we decided to take her down to Children's Hospital.
<p />
At least when she left, Tiffy wasn't crying any more. I'm praying this ends well. Of course, my first thoughts were of Tiffy's birthday party soon and how pictures would turn out. I hope that's the worst of all this.
