I got home from work last night while the family was out doing karate and soccer (BTW, two kid's activities in the same night is insane).  The house was a little warmer than I'm used to.

Carla and I have been doing some serious talks about reducing our budget in an effort to plan for some upcoming events.  One of the things she did was bump the AC up another two degrees.  It doesn't sound like much, but every little bit helps.

So the house is warmer than I'm used to.  I go up to my office to start hacking on one of my projects.  Of course, my office is warmer than the rest of the house because of the "home file server":http://www.lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/HomeFileServer I have running in there.

So I'm working away and the family gets home.  Carla goes over to the thermostat and proclaims that it's 89 degrees F in the house; only about five degrees cooler than outside!  The short story is that the bearings in my blower have seized.  By this time it's 8:15pm and I can't get (or don't want to pay even rates for) an HVAC man to come out.

If the basement had been half-way clean I would have moved us all down there to sleep.  As it was, we all sweated in our beds.  I don't remember the last time a cool shower felt so good!
