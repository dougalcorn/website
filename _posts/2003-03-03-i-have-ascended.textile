My coffee drinking pursuit has reached its zenith.  This morning I drank freshly roasted, freshly ground Jamacia Blue Mountain coffee.  We're talking $45/pound locally roasted coffee.  Is it good?  Yes, quite.  Is it worth $45/pound?  I certainly wouldn't pay that much for it.  It has a rich flavor (similar to Starbuck's), but no bitterness at all.  The aftertaste is very mild.  Starbuck's is definitely more "burnt" tasting.  I've tried several different brands of Sumatra that are very good.  In fact, Costco's Kirkland brand has a Sumatra that is very good.  For the money, I'd definitely drink that over Jamacian Blue Mountain.
