<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/"><img src="http://lathi.net/images/df111803sm.jpg" alt="" border="0" width="320" height="240" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" /></a>I mentioned yesterday that I like to fantasize about how I would spend <a href="http://lathi.net/diary/WishList.writeback" target="_top">discretionary if I had it</a>.  Last night I was trying to get a better picture of how much a <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/ReefAquarium">ReefAquarium</a> would cost.  In the midst of surfing around on it I came across <a href="http://www.garf.org/" target="_top">http://www.garf.org/</a>.  Leroy Headlee has done a lot of research into the subject of marine farming.  On his site he has lots and lots of information about setting up a marine farming business.  This is a big hot button with me.  I've wanted to own a fish store for nearly 10 years (Sports fans will note that's back when I was in college).  Anyway, I was reading all this optimistic literature and thinking, "Hey, I could do this!".  Realistically though I'm nowhere near ready to even start something like this.  I talked to Carla about it via IM.  Her responce was, "QUIT IT!".  Heh, well, she's right.  The only reason I decided to blog this was because of the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/" target="_top">Doctor Fun</a> cartoon for today.
