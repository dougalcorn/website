Carla and I went out Saturday night for my birthday.  It's the first time we've been out just the two of us for a couple months (I think since Thanksgiving back in November).  So, the pressure's on.  What to do that's more "special" than the old "dinner and a movie"?  Since Carla and I are both interested in photography I thought dinner and a photo shoot would be fun.  Give us a chance alone talking and working together rather than just sitting in a dark room staring at a big screen.
<p />
So the question became what to shoot.  It had to be at night because that's all our schedule would allow.  We have a good quality local fish store.  I thought about going there and photographing some of the fish.  I'm pretty sure that wouldn't have appealed to Carla.  I thought she likes to photograph flowers.  I couldn't find anywhere indoors (and thus hopefully well lit at night) where we could tastefully come in with camera and tripod to make some photographs.
<p />
Then it hit me.  Carla loves the view of downtown Cincinnati from the Kentucky side of the river.   <a href="http://newportonthelevee.com/" target="_top">Newport on the Levee</a> is a mix of indoor and outdoor mall.  They have several nice restaurants and a fairly nice walkway along the river.  I didn't know anything about any of the restaurants down there other than they seemed nice enough for our date night.  We ended up at <a href="http://www.fatfishblue.com/newport/index.htm" target="_top">Fat Fish Blue</a>.  It was a long wait for a table, so I suggested we go ahead and walk along the river to find a good spot to shoot.  It was very cold and we didn't really dress well enough to spend a lot of time outside.
<p />
We went back to Fat Fish Blue and had to wait longer.  Turns out there was a live band playing, <a href="http://www.studebakerjohn.com/" target="_top">Studebaker John</a> is a trio from Chicago playing a pretty good blues rock.  We listened to them play for about 30 minutes while we waited for our table.  About the time our table was ready, the band took a break; which was nice because then it was quiet enough to actually talk.  I bought the CD the band was selling because I know the money mostly goes directly to them.  I like to support good bands directly when I can.  Dinner was better than average New Orleans style cooking.

The most of SE Ohio has had quite a bit of flooding the last week or so.  The Ohio river had crested about two days prior.  Our main goal was to get some good photos that could be stitched into a panoramic of the city-scape.  We also wanted to get some shots that showed the extent of the flooding.  Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot of evidence of the flooding to make a photograph out of.  We took a few photographs of a pier/walkway that was submerged with light posts sticking out of the water.  Carla took a couple of hand-held shots of the city-scape, the best of which is shown here.  At this point it was bitterly cold outside.  Carla had gloves, but I didn't.  My fingers were so cold working with the aluminum tripod and trying to adjust the camera.  So, we setup for the panoramic shots, took the first one, and then the battery on the camera died.
<p />
Overall, it was almost a perfect evening.  We had a lot of fun doing something out of the ordinary.  The time together was great.  I just wish I had remembered to charge the camera battery before we left.
