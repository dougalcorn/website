We're a dog family.  We've "missed Princess":http://blog.lathi.net/articles/2005/06/26/in-memory-of-our-best-friend a great deal and we've missed the company of a family dog.  We did our research and decided on a "labradoodle":http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/labradoodle.htm.  The kids (and I) wanted a bigger dog this time and Carla's allergies needed a non- to low shedding dog.  We went through "2000 Dog Names":http://www.petrix.com/dognames/ with the kids: first building a long list of names we liked, then a short list, then a really short list.  We settled on Koszmo.

He's only 8 weeks old (born May 30, 2005), but he's already bigger than Princess was; quite clumsy too.  Everyone's very happy to have another dog.  He seems smart and well mannered.  We've been working on the basics of "sit" and "off".  No accidents yet (only one day).  He's familiar enough with going outside if we can just remember to take him out as often as he needs to go.  Of course, his first day (when I need to be taking him outside all the time) is also the first day we've had any rain in like two months.  He chews, of course.  Last night he was a little disoriented, but today he's playing with his toys and doing some fetching.

It's been a _long_ time since we've had a puppy.  Here's hoping the next eight weeks goes well!  By the way, here's the "first batch of photos":http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/08-August/Kozmo/JPEG/.
