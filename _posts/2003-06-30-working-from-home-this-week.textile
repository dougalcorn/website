This is my week from home.  I've made promises to <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><font color="#0000FF">MichelleZaller</font></span><a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/edit/Main/MichelleZaller?topicparent=Main.WebHome">?</a> that I'll get some specific things accomplished this week to help meet her schedule.  Since this is a short week I need to stay very focused to get everything done I said I'd do.  So, I'll be working "off-line" this week to remove the distraction of the Internet.  If you need me, call my cell phone (513) 295-2844.
