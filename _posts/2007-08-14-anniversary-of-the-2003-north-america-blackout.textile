It turns out today is the four year anniversary of the blackout that had 40 million Americans and 10 million Canadians without power.  I was in Cleveland at the time.  Here's my story of "Sitting in the Dark":http://blog.lathi.net/articles/2003/08/14/sitting-in-the-dark.

I wrote that article using the last remaining minutes of my laptop battery.  The whole thing freaked me out a bit as you can tell by the writing.  To this day I make sure I travel with a flashlight.  I hate to recycle material here on my blog, but I enjoyed the flashback.
