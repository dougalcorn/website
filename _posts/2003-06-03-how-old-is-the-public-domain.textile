It's a long path to get to me, but
<a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/" target="_top">Lessig's Blog</a> recants a
story found in <em>The Invention of Printing in China</em>, by Thomas Carter
(1955) about the first book every printed.  On page 56 Carter says,
<p />
<blockquote>
The book consists of six sheets of text and one shorter sheet with 
woodcut, all neatly pasted together so as to form one continuous roll 
sixteen feet long... At the end, printed into the text, is the 
statement that the book was "reverently made for universal free 
distribution by Wang Chieh on behalf of his two parents on the 15th 
of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Hsien-t'ung."
</blockquote>
<p />
Designated Universal Free Distribution from day one.
