After this morning's <a href="http://www.lathi.net/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/Family/NewFathers.writeback" target="_top">post</a> I feel kinda stupid having tried to give advice to new fathers.  The friend, <a href="http://www.yerot.com/~yerase/blog/blosxom.cgi" target="_top">Randall Hand</a>, I was referring to had their baby <a href="http://www.yerot.com/~yerase/blog/blosxom.cgi/Family/birth.writeback" target="_top">early this morning</a>.  The catch is she's five weeks early.  Randall says Rhianna will have to stay in the hospital 4 - 8 weeks.  This is definitely not the way you want to have any baby, much less your first.  It sounds like things are going as well as they can; <a href="http://www.yerot.com/~yerase/blog/blosxom.cgi/Family/birthupdate.writeback" target="_top">just stressful</a>.
