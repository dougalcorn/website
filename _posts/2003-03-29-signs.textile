Last night Carla brought home "Signs" to watch.  I was a little leary of watching it.  From the trailers it looked like a second-rate Mel Gibson film using cheap scare tactics.  I was pleasantly surprised by the film (or should I say pleasantly thrilled?).  I've seen all three big name films from M. Night Shayamalan: "The Sixth Sense", "Unbreakable", and now "Signs".  Honestly I've been a little leary of all three.  But I've enjoyed all three films.  This one was no exception.  In all three the plot seems very simple from the trailers.  I see the trailer and think, "Hmm, that looks like the same ol' same ol'."  Typically his plots <em>are</em> simple.  However, M.N. Shayamalan directs them so very well.  He reminds me quite a bit of Alfred Hitchcock (even in how he likes to do cameo role in his own films).  Anyway, I recommend this film.  Watch it if you haven't.
