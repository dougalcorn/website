Make no mistake, I'm not a professional photographer.  This was a hard environment to shoot.  Overall I'm mostly pleased with the results.  I saved about 50 images, probably 20 or so I'm actually proud of.  You can browse through them in my "gallery of MCC Xmas Images":http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/12-December/MCC_2005/JPEG/

Shane is a friend of mine and the worship minister at MCC.  He invited my family to the show last year.  My camera was about a month old at the time, and I couldn't help but "shoot the show":http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2004/12-December/MCC/.  I got a few good images that he liked.  His official church photographer moved away, so left without a better alternative, he asked me to shoot this year's show.  I think I did better than last year.  I certainly kept more images.  Of course, I was shooting a lot more images too.  Last year, I was kinda sneaking around and taking a shot here and there.  This year I was pretty much continually shooting.<a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/12-December/MCC_2005/JPEG/20051210_013.jpg"><img src="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/12-December/MCC_2005/JPEG/.cache/50x75-20051210_013.jpg" width="50" height="75" alt="Dancing for Joy" align="right" class="alignright" /></a>

In fact, I really didn't get to enjoy the show as much.  Knowing they do three or four shows, I should have attended one just to watch and enjoy.  Then I'd be more in the loop to know what to shoot and be better prepared.  Oh, well... maybe next year.

BTW, these were all shot with my Canon Digital Rebel and either my Canon 50mm/f1.8 or my Sigma 70mm - 200mm/f2.8.  After a few sample shots, I set my ISO to 800 and left it there.  I didn't want mucking with the ISO to be something I had to worry about while shooting.  The stage lighting was hard to deal with.  Plus the choir was wearing white shirts with a spotlight on them.  They also made heavy use of blue lighting filters that tended to blow that channel.  My Rebel was having a hard time keeping up with both auto-focus and auto-exposure.  No doubt a Canon 20D would have done better.
