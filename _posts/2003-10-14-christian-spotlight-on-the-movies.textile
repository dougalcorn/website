I sometimes visit <a href="http://ChristianAnswers.Net/spotlight/home.html" target="_top">Christian Spotlight on the Movies</a>.  They have pretty good reviews (obviously from a Christian perspective).  I've been fairly distracted by "Kill Bill" today.  I went over to <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><font color="#0000FF">CPotM</font></span><a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/edit/Main/CPotM?topicparent=Main.WebHome">?</a> to see what they had to say about it.  Turns out they didn't have a review up yet.  On their main page is a request for new movie reviewers.  So I hunted around and found the form to submit a review.  I ended up writing a bit more than I did <a href="http://lathi.net/diary/Movies/KillBill.writeback" target="_top">here</a> on my blog.  Who knows if they'll take it.  When I look at their <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/spotlight/movies/reviews.html" target="_top">current needs list</a> I see that "Kill Bill" is already assigned to someone.  However, the due date was also four days ago.  I enjoy writing and would like to build up a list of "published" works.  We'll see what happens.
