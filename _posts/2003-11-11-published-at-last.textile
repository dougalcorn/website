I submitted a review of "Kill Bill Volume 1" to <a href="http://ChristianAnswers.Net/spotlight/home.html" target="_top">Christian Spotlight on the Movies</a> some time back.  I had been checking regularly to see if it was published.  For a "long time" they simply didn't have a review up.  Eventually I decided they just weren't going to publish my review.  Just for kicks and grins I went by to see that they had <a href="http://christiananswers.net/spotlight/movies/2003/killbillvolume1.html" target="_top">published my review</a>!
