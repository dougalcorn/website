Speaking of irresponsible parenting, I just went downstairs to find the boys wrestling together.  On the surface, that sounds OK.  Both boths were laughing.  It hadn't degenerated to tears yet.  However, their "wrestling" consisted of Josh with a couch pillow smaking Justin while he was laying down on the ground.  The very instant I walked in the room Josh had the pillow over Justin's face.  I took that opportunity to explain to Josh: wresting with your brother <code>= good; pillow on face =</code> bad.
