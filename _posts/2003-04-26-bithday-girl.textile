Last weekend I rended <em>Birthday Girl</em> and haven't had time to watch it.  Last night (after some friends came over for dinner) Carla and I watched it.  Carla says she's seen it before but she didn't remember much of it.  This film can best be described as a "black romantic comedy."  It's more than a little odd but still entertaining.
