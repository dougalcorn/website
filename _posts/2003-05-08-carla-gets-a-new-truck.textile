Carla's 1998 Dodge Durango just "rolled over" 100,000 miles the other day.  For you young whipper-snappers out there.  Older cars used to only have five digits for the odometer.  So, every 100,000 miles the odometer would read zero miles.  This was/is referred to as "rolling it over".  Since new cars obviously have zero miles you can see where the title comes from.  OK, I know most of my readers know all this.  Maybe in five or 10 years my kids will read this and wonder what it all means.  About her truck, if you do the math we're averaging over 20,000 miles a year in a vehicle that consistently gets 13 - 15 miles to the gallon. Yikes!  Gas is averaging $1.30 per gallon or so.  That means this year her vehicle will cost us nearly $2000 to drive assuming nothing goes wrong with it.
