I dreamed I was at some party last night; maybe something like a big geek Christmas party.  We were roleplaying D&D; or acting out D&amp;D, or something.  Anyway, this guy (who in the dream I knew fairly well but can't remember now) brings another guy in (who none of us knew).  This new guy gave an obvious false name; like he was using some nick-name for the D&amp;D roleplaying.  Anyway, this new guy and I started sword fighting.  We were mostly playing (and role-playing), but it was also somewhat serious.  After several minutes of sword fighting I started getting the impression that I knew who this guy was.  After a bit, I started hinting that I knew who he really was.  I didn't want to come out and say who he was because it would have spoiled the role-playing.  Without further ado (and the point of this blog post) this guy was <a href="http://www.discovery.com/area/technology/hackers/mitnick.html" target="_top">Kevin Mitnick</a>!
