Last night President Bush announced to the world that Sadam Hussen and his sons had 48 hours to leave Iraq.  If they failed to do so we would attack at a time of our choosing.  I don't know if I really support the Gulf War II or not.  I regret that it's going to happen.  I pray almost daily that it can be avoided somehow.  Even with that said, I thought the President's speach was pretty good.  It was pretty quick and high level.  He very clearly layed out his intentions.  I hope his concern and accomodations for the Iraqi people is genuine.  I pray for them most of all.
