It astounds me I'm able to read <a href="http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/" target="_top">Dear Raed</a>.  Despite living in Bagdad, he seems to be doing OK.  He does describe images on TV of heavy civilian casualties and describes his fear of urban warfare.  I think they are afraid and angry, but mostly afraid.  My heart goes out to them.  I truely wish we weren't bombing them.  I don't think I'm smart enough to know whether this was is "necessary" or not.  Whether it is or isn't, the Iraqi people are the ones to suffer the most.

I find it incongruent to read his description of having to go hunt for food in the stores, not having any meat, paying all their money just to get some vegetables and then I go downstairs and choose what kind of snack I want.  It's only by the grace of God that I have the life I do.  I could have been born to an Iraqi family.  I'm not that different from Raed: just a tech guy trying to make it.  Only the odds are heavily against him.  I feel like I'm having a tough time in our current US economy.  Just think if our currency was so devalued.  What has Raed done to deserve the circumstances he's in?  What have I done to deserve mine?  The answer's the same in both questions.
