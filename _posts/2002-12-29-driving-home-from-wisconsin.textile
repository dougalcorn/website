The trip home went very smothly considering we had three kids under five
in the car for roughly 12 hours.  Here are the lessons learned from
the trip.  1) Tiffany is an extremely patient baby when it comes to
car traveling.  2) Joshua is learning to tell time in units of how
many movies it takes to get there.  3) Justin clearly knows how to
aggravate his brother.
