Josh has some friends over right now playing.  He went to his room to put a quarter in his bank.  When he came back down he was wearing his Spiderman costume over his clothes.  "Hey, Dad.  I'm not going to play Spiderman.  I just wanted to look cool right now."
<p />
Of course, two minutes later he comes back up stairs with a scratch on his leg.  He's insisting on a band-aid even though there is clearly no blood.  When I tell him to go play, he goes off hobling like his foot has been amputated.  I guess cool has its limits.
