<a href="http://www.beautiful-landscape.com/" target="_top">Alain Briot</a> is a respected landscape photographer and teacher working mainly out of the Grand Canyon and the west.  He publishes regularly to <a href="http://luminous-landscape.com" target="_top">Luminous Landscape</a>.  Today Micheal Reichmann published an essay by Alain on why he's <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/columns/1Ds-4x5.shtml" target="_top">switching from 4x5 to a Canon 1DsMkII</a>.  Interestingly, his reasoning isn't related to image quality.  In fact, he had 100% crops of images from both cameras at various sizes that showed greater detail and richer colors from the 4x5.  He mitigates that by saying at print size they are very similar.  However, the big win is workflow.  Every shoot he does in 4x5 film takes him two weeks to processes.  With a digital workflow, his time is cut to a day at most.

I don't have a medium format 4x5 or a 1DsMkII; nor will I any time soon.  However, I love to hear stories of respected photographers making the switch to digital.  I've never been interested in film photography.  Seeing stuff like this makes me feel like I'll never advance to the point where only film will do.  I like to think that I can advance as far as I can without needing any film.
