I don't know if that's it official name or not, but somewhere along the line there is a specific doll Carla refers to as "Big Baby".  Carla found one of these dolls on sale somewhere today for $9.  The good news is that both Carla and Tiffany are happy. <img alt="smile" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/smile.gif" />  Tiffy's been playing with it nearly non-stop since then.  Carla's quite pleased that her little girl is so into her doll.  At one point during Tiffany's nap I went in to quieten her down and found her tucking big-baby in. <img alt="smile" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/smile.gif" />  I have a very cute little girl.
