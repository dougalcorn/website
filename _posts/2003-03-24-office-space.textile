I watched "Office Space" last night.  Very funny movie.  Possibly the most realistic film ever made about life as a coporate computer guy.  I had seen it several times before; but, this was Carla's first time.  I had forgotten how bad the language is in that movie.  However, like many other aspects of this film, the use of language is a realistic representation of what it's really like to work for a "bigco" (Big Company).  "Yeaaa...  That'd be greeaat..."
