<img src="http://craphound.com/images/amphibioushouse.jpg" width="270" height="131" align="left"> Ever since I saw "Houseboat":http://imdb.com/title/tt0051745/ with "Sophia Loren":http://imdb.com/name/nm0000047/ I've wanted to live on a house boat.  With the recent flooding problems there may be more interest in it.  Check out these Dutch floating houses.

<blockquote>These Dutch houses are designed to float if the ground they sit on gets flooded, rising with the tidewater. Regine at WMMNA has a great post on the burgeoning amphibious house movement. -- <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/007141.php">Link</a>
