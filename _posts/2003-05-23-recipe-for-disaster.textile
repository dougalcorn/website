New grill innards, aluminum foil, honey-glazed meat.  I used to wait like 10 or 15 minutes for my grill to get hot.  It just wouldn't put out enough flame.  Not thinking, I waited 15 minutes for my grill to get hot while it was on high.  Even though I got new grill "innards", I didn't get new racks for it.  My old ones are cast iron and very rusty.  I've recently despaired of ever getting them clean enough to cook on.  Instead I thought I would just use aluminum foil to cover them up.  When I slapped those sugary coated steaks down on that searingly, hellishly hot grill it was instant charcoal.  I never had a chance.  The meat itself turned out OK if you cut the 1/8th inch burned sugar off the outside.  It actually kinda made it more juicy.

Every time I grill it's a roll of the dice.  We don't have a deck or a patio on this house.  The only place to keep the grill is in the garage.  As a result, we don't grill as much.  I seem to forget everything I learn about grilling in between grilling sessions.  Each time I grill it's like the first time.  I have memories of actually being pretty good at grilling.  I don't really know what happened.  Oh well.  Maybe I'll start keeping notes on my grilling experiences here.  That way each time I get ready to grill I'll come review before I start.

I'll say this though: it's nice to have a grill that actually grills.
