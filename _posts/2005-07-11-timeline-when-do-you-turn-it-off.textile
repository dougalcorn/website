I don't know why we didn't turn it off.  At some point in the movie you realize it's bad.  Hopefully, it's very early in the film.  My guess is that we hesitate to turn movies off because of the time investment.  You've already watch 45 minutes; you feel like you should go ahead and finish it.  "I'm not quitter!"

I had seen the trailers and it looked kind of interesting.  It was kind of interesting.  The story idea was pretty good.  The scenes looked great.  Those poor actors did their best.  But this film suffered from a terrible script.  The lines were just awful.
<p />
This was based on a novel by <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000341/" target="_top">Michael Crichton</a>.  He's been part of other great movies like: <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0112715/" target="_top">Congo</a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0117998/" target="_top">Twister</a>, and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0120184/" target="_top">Sphere</a>.  To be fair, he also wrote <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0066769/" target="_top">The Andromeda Strain</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0107290/" target="_top">Jurasic Park</a>.

Anyway, don't go see this movie.
