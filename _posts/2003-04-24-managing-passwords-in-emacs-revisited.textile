For those of you that actually read my previous <a href="http://www.lathi.net/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2003/4/11#Emacs_PasswordGenerator" target="_top">post</a> on using emacs to manage passwords and followed the link to <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?AutoEncryption" title="'AutoEncryption' on the Emacs Wiki">Emacs:AutoEncryption</a>, you'll remember that I had a few gripes about the way it worked.  Most irritating was how the password file was always marked as modified.  After being prompted enough times to save the password file (when I knew it hadn't changed) while I was compiling, I finally fixed it.  I'm very happy with this setup now.
