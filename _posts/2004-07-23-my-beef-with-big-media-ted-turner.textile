<a href="http://arstechnica.com/" target="_top">Ars Technica</a> pointed out an article by Ted Turner published in the <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/" target="_top">Washington Monthly</a> entitled <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0407.turner.html" target="_top">"My Beef With Big Media"</a>.  This is a great article on the perils our society faces when all of our media choises are decided by mega-conglomerates motived by short-term profit motives.  I couldn't count the number of people I've worked for and with over the years that have lamented the need to meet their quartery numbers.  I'm no fan of super-large companies.  I think the rules they operate by and the motivations are often at odds with society at large.
