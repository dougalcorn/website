I'm on a mailing list run by one of my clients called <a href="http://mail.jeankelley.com/mailman/listinfo/e-nspirations" target="_top">E-nspirations</a>.  It's a mostly periodic but somewhat infrequent mini-article written by <a href="http://www.jeankelley.com/" target="_top">Jean Kelley</a>.  Today's message was prompted by the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.  Jean says, "The significance of this event sent me to my bookshelf where I found Victor Frankl's Book, <em>Man's Search for Meaning</em>."

The last of the human freedoms is to chose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances. -- Victor Frankl

I read <em>Man's Search for Meaning</em> in college while I was studying in Vienna, Austria.  It is a powerful book that I read during an pivotal time in my life.  It's message is old and familiar.  I have had the "power to chose" drilled into me all my life.  And yet, I still seem to forget it.  I still seem to let my environment dictate my responses; or my moods swing back and forth.  Remembering the horrors of Auschwitz and yet Frankl can make the above statement hits me particularly powerfully today.
