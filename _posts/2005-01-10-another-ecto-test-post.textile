One of the problems I had with using Ecto before was with some of my blosxom plugins. Specifically, I use a plugin that convertes the blog story into HTML using the TWiki engine. When I was just writing plain text files, this was really handy. Ecto tries to do the HTML formatting for me. There was a disconnect between Ecto and my TWiki renderer.

So, this is a test of Ecto with turning off the twikirenderer for this post but leaving it on for all my old stuff.
