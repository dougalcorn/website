I took off from work and went to South Carolina to visit my family for Christmas.  We left on Saturday, Dec 20 and came home the following Saturday.  
<p />
The trip is about 600 miles and takes us about 11 hours start to finish.  Both trips went pretty well.  We take along one of those power inverters so that we can run a normal "A/C" TV and VCR in the car.  This year we took along our <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/GameCube">GameCube</a> in the car too.  They boys enjoyed that.  I guess it's a sign that our kids are getting older that we only had a couple of screaming fits.
<p />
It was really nice to have time away.  My kids played really well with their cousins.  Another sign of them aging is the lack of fighting over toys for the most part.  Probably the best part of the whole trip was that my Dad, who normally gets up fairly early in the morning, got up with the kids and let Carla and I sleep.  I don't think I got up before 9:30am the whole week.  Christmas morning was the obvious exception.
<p />
We suffered the age old question: what's the best way for kids to open their presents?  Do you give them one at a time for them to open?  Give them the whole pile and let them tear into it?  This year we opted for something more chaotic and just allowed all the kids to just tear into all their presents.  Two words: sensory overload.  It was just too much pandemonium for Tiffany (who will be two in a few days).  She just didn't know how to handle it all, started screaming, and nothing would placate her except taking her out of the room.  Taking it a bit more slow, she was able to open all her presents and enjoy it.
<p />
Overall it was a fun trip.  I'm glad we went.  I was pleased at how well the kids played.  I was pleased with how much time my kids got to spend with Grandma and Grandpa.  I was pleased with the time I had with my Sister and her husband.  I was also pleased to get to see some extended family too.  Holidays are good for that.  Even though it's a tough trip down and back, even though the holidays in general are stressful, even though it's not much fun living out of a suitcase or having odd sleeping arangements it's still good to have a time of year when everyone expects to get together.  They expect to have fun.  Not unexpectedly we did. <img alt="smile" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/smile.gif" />
