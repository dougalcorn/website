I saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0328107/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTIwMHx0dD1vbnxwbj0wfHE9bWFuIG9uIGZpcmV8aHRtbD0xfG5tPW9u;fc=1;ft=21;fm=1" target="_top">Man on Fire</a> probably a year ago on pay-per-view in a Cleveland hotel.  We've actually rented this movie at least three times since Carla wanted to also see it.  We're both big <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000243/" target="_top">Denzel Washington</a> fans.  In my opinion he may be the best man on the screen right now.  I've never seen a bad performance from him including this one.  I said we've rented it several times and we have.  However, last night was Carla's first time to see it.  Every other time we've rented it we've not had time to watch it before it was due back. <img alt="frown" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/frown.gif" />

I wasn't really sure how Carla would like this film.  It is an intense action/revenge movie that's usually not her style.  She likes action films well enough, but certainly not the really gritty ones.  She definitely doesn't like films that don't fit the Hollywood style of action (like <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0112573/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTIwMHx0dD1vbnxwbj0wfHE9YnJhdmVoZWFydHxodG1sPTF8bm09b24_;fc=1;ft=13;fm=1" target="_top">Braveheart</a>).  Before she'd watch this one she had to know, "Does the girl die?"  No.  She didn't think to ask any other questions about the plot.

When I was getting ready to write my review of this film, I found <a href="http://www.geocities.com/gamut_mag/manfire.htm" target="_top">this review</a> by Mike McGranaghan on <a href="http://www.geocities.com/gamut_mag/aisle.htm" target="_top">The Aisle Seat</a>.  He basically says everything I was going to.  Overall I like the film.  Given the opportunity I don't think I'd turn down a chance to see a Denzel Washington movie.  However, this is not one I can watch over and over (any more than "Braveheart" is).
