Today's another missed snow day that I'm at work instead of at home playing with the kids.  I shouldn't beat myself up too much; I have to work.  I've also gotten some good time in with them recently.  I just miss working from home and the ability to see them more frequently.  I miss being able to take an hour to go play during the day.  Based on my current position, I don't have any idea how to get that back though.
<p />
As many of you know, my last job was 50% working from home and 50% commuting four hours up I-71.  The travel was hard, but working from home was nice.  I kept trying to get my boss to let me have more time working from home.  She never budged.  I'm pretty sure she resented me asking about it.  I think she felt like I was taking advantage of her.
<p />
I got some email from her last night.  The group we both worked in was sold to a company in New Jersey.  Pretty much anyone who wanted to keep their job moved there except her.  She accepted a six month contract with them to help with the transition.  So, she's been working from home these last several months.  I think yesterday was the third time she's told me "I don't know how you dragged your butt up here to Cleveland."  I think she really "gets" now the pleasure of working from home.
<p />
Maybe I'll have that again some day.  I'll have to think about what type of career path would lead me there.
