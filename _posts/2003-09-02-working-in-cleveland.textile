Drove up to Cleveland this morning.  I'll be up here for the rest of the week.  This is the fourth day in a row to have rain.  Makes me think I'm working in South Florida or something ;-).  Of course, after living in Oklahoma for as many years as I did I swore I'd never complain about the rain again.  So this is me not complaining.
