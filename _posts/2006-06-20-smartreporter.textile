I just now noticed that "SMARTReporter":http://homepage.mac.com/julianmayer/ has gone Universal.  This is a tool pretty much every one on a Mac should be running.  It checks the Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology status of your hard disks and lets you know when something bad is about to happen.

When I switched to my Macbook Pro, it wasn't available for Intel Macs.  Now it is! Yay for Julian Mayer!
