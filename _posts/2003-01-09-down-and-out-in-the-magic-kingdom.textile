Ok, I'll join the crowd.  <a href="http://www.craphound.com/" target="_top">Cory Doctorow</a>'s first <a href="http://www.craphound.com/down/" target="_top">novel</a>, <em>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</em>, is good.  I really enjoyed reading it.  You can either <a href="http://www.craphound.com/down/buy.php" target="_top">buy</a> it or <a href="http://www.craphound.com/down/download.php" target="_top">download it for free</a>.
