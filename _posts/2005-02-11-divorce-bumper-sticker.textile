I saw a bumper-sticker on the way home that made me go, "Hmm."  There's no secret, I really don't like divorce.  Jesus' teaching on it clear.  There are a few exceptions, but in general God hates divorce and I pretty much do too.  I'm not going to apologize for that; it's just where I am.  I know marriage is hard.  You don't make just shy of 13 years without knowing that.

One of the things I hate about divorce is what it does to the kids in the family.  I've seen enough divorces to know kids aren't unaffected by it.  I had breakfast one morning with a guy (from church) who ended up divorcing his wife.  "My boys will take it OK.  They'll still turn out alright."  I agree his boys will cope and adjust.  But why give them that extra battle to fight.  As parents we should be helping our kids as much as possible; not throwing up trauma for them to deal with.

Anyway... the bumper sticker.  It was about 4" x 6", green on black stuck to the back of a black Jeep Cherokee.  "I'm still mad about my parent's divorce."  The girl driving looked to be in her mid 20s.  I wish I would have snapped a picture of either the bumper sticker or the girl.  I don't know what to think about the girl putting that on her SUV to drive around.  I don't know if it was even her SUV.  It could have been a joke.  But that the bumper sticker even exists says something about the impact divorce has on kids.
