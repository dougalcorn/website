title: Pasting Passwords at the Emacs Prompt

(How's that for alliteration?)  I use <a href="http://fpm.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">Figaro's Password Manager</a> to keep track of all my username password combinations.  It's not fantastic, but it works.  It allows me to select a username and put the password into the copy buffer.  The idea is that I simply paste it into whatever password prompt without having to type it.  The problem is that due to the history of emacs (being used by multiple people on a single host) memory isn't trusted any more than it needs to be for password storage.  Therefore, emacs doesn't trust the copy buffer for storing passwords and wouldn't allow the paste operation when prompting for a password. <img alt="frown" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/frown.gif" />  In today's environment (everyone pretty much has their own computer and runs emacs locally on a single user computer) I find this behavior highly annoying.  So, I finally figured out how to "trick" emacs into accepting a pasted password.  I made of copy of the read-passwd-map in my .xemacs/init.el and added a binding for "C-y" to yank-clipboard-selection.  This effectively puts the paste opperation back into the list of allowed operations at the password prompt.  The advantage of modifying the read-password-prompt is that every application that reads a password will now pick up this modification!
