I don't remember exactly what it was that made me put it in our rental queue.  It has Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts, and Clive Owen.  The movie is extremely well done.  The story is consistent, believable, well-directed, and impeccably acted.  Definitely not a Hollywood ending though.  The music is somewhat haunting.  After the movie finished I watched all the credits because the music kept me drawn into the emotion of the story.

In looking, I see it's directed by <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0001566/" target="_top">Mike Nichols</a>, someone I didn't really recognize.  However, he's also done <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0061722/" target="_top">The Graduate</a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0119942/" target="_top">Primary Colors</a>, and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0094746/" target="_top">Biloxi Blues</a> among many others.  Very respectable movies.  The writer is <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0544999/" target="_top">Patrick Marber</a>; but I didn't recognize anything else he's done.

I probably wouldn't have posted about this movie (except I want Viraj to see this; it's his kind of movie) except I found out more information about the music.  Today there's a new shared library on our company's network in iTunes.  As I was listening to random songs from it, the theme song from the movie started up: "The Blower's Daughter" by <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#38;sql=1:DAMIEN|RICE~C" target="_top">Damien Rice</a>.  Turns out this guy has the whole album the song comes off of.  Really good moody music.  This is definitely on my "to buy" list.
