So what in the world has happened?  It's been 122 days since I've posted anything to my weblog.  The only explaination I have is inertia.  I got swamped on serveral projects that were going on at the same time and just haven't gotten back in the swing of writing.  I feel guilty that I've abandoned this journal for so long.  I can't really explain it.  In the past I was drawn to write and lately I haven't been.  This post is "breaking the ice".  Now I've started posting again and shouldn't have the dread of going back to an abandoned blog.  Expect more later.
