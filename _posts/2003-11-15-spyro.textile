We rented Spyro today for our <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/GameCube">GameCube</a>.  Oh, my goodness is this game fun! <img alt="OK" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/okay.gif" /> You play this little purple adolescent dragon.  You run around doing things little dragons do (flame things, eat sheep, ram things with your horns, fly around, etc.).  The setting is in China (maybe Japan, this shows my ignorance) in a series of Dragon dojos.  There are bad ninja dudes that are trying to steal all the dragonflies.  Your job is to catch all the dragonflies to protect them from the Bad Guys.  Meanwhile you're learning how to be a big dragon.  The animation is great, the game play is great.  All of the kids love it.  It's a little hard for Josh (who's now six) to do all the "challenges".  So, I'm watching him play and "help" when he gets to the sticky parts.  The game is so much fun I have a hard time giving him back the controller! <img alt="embarrassment" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/blush.gif" />

Here's a for instance on what a bad father I am.  Today is actually Josh's Birthday.  We had his party last weekend while Grandma and Grandpa were here.  Josh is having a hard time understanding why he doesn't get a birthday party today as well as last weekend.  I think he's getting it, but it's taken most of the day.  So, I'm sitting there playing after "helping him through a hard part" and he's wanting the controller back.  He says things like, "Can I have a turn?" and "Dad, I think I can do this part."  Finally he says to me, "Dad, I think it's my turn.  You know it's my birthday."
