While I'm crunching through photos, here's some more:

<a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/07-July/Grandma-Grandpa/JPEG/"><img src="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/07-July/Grandma-Grandpa/JPEG/.cache/100x66-20050718_067.jpg" width="100" height="66" alt="Extreme Close-up of Tiffy" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="10" align="left"/></a> "Here's":http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/07-July/Grandma-Grandpa/JPEG/ some photos we took while Grandma and Grandpa were visiting.  These are mostly by Carla, but I've got a couple in there too.

<a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/07-July/Yellow%20Belt%20Test/JPEG/"><img src="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/07-July/Yellow%20Belt%20Test/JPEG/.cache/50x75-20050718_104.jpg" width="50" height="75" alt="Joshua punching" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" border="0" /></a> "Here's":http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/07-July/Yellow%20Belt%20Test/JPEG/ some photos I took at the boys' Karate Yellow Belt Test.  Nothing too exciting. It _was_ there first belt test; but I'm very proud of them for how well they've done so far.

<a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/07-July/Hiking/JPEG/"><img src="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/07-July/Hiking/JPEG/.cache/50x75-20050718_198.jpg" width="50" height="75" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="10" alt="Boys in the Woods" border="0"/></a> Last, but not least, "here's":http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/07-July/Hiking/JPEG/ some photos I took the other day while the boys and I were out hiking.
