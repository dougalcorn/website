I found a link to <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/" target="_top">http://www.cdbaby.com/</a>.  This looks like a really cool on-line store to let you sample music that is 100% independent.  It's a nicely designed site with lots of music.  Check it out if you <em>really</em> want to "stick it to the man".  Give musicians an outlet to make money that doesn't involve the RIAA.
