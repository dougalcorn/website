We "finished" painting the hallway last night.  Truth be told, we ran out of paint.  Either Carla was being optimistic or simply cautious.  Whichever way, she only got two gallons of paint.  We were thinking of getting five and doing all of the upstairs hallway too.  Gladly we decided to stop at the top of the stairs.  I like the color OK.  Carla really likes it.  We'll need to get some white and trim our baseboards (and four doorways).  Our house is painted solid grey from floor to ceiling everywhere but the entry way hall now.  Unfortunately that gray doesn't go very well with the yellow we just put in the hall.  The good news is that the yellow does very nice with our wood floor.  It makes it look much warmer than with the cool grey.  So, in conclusion, this was a successful painting experience.  For $40 we have a bright, warm entry way with clean walls.  Now if we can just keep the kids from coloring on these...
