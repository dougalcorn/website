The weather was horrible and I didn't know if anyone was going to venture out.  We had only invited two families to come over plus my parents are in town.  <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/01-January/Tiffany-Birthday/2005-01-22_083.jpg"><img src="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/01-January/Tiffany-Birthday/.cache/100x66-2005-01-22_083.jpg" width="100" height="66" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" border="0" /></a>It was an intimate little party that was most enjoyable.  When you only have six kids, the stress level is much lower.  Carla made another impressive cake.  I managed to get a <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2005/01-January/Tiffany-Birthday/">few good photos</a>.  The two shown here are my favorites of the day.
