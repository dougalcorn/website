For those of you not aware of my wife Carla's <a href="http://carla.lathi.net/diary/" target="_top">blog</a>, I wanted to link to <a href="http://carla.lathi.net/blog/tooth_fairy.html" target="_top">this story</a> she wrote about our seven year-old son, Joshua.  I just read it this morning while at work and it made me laugh out loud.
<p />
BTW, I'm really glad Carla is writing again too.  It's stuff like this story that I don't want to forget.
