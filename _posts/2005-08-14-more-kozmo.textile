These are actually a week old, but I'm just now getting around to processing them.  I took about 40 and ended up with just these five.

We're really enjoying him.  He's training pretty well.  It's fun to tool around in the yard and have a puppy follow you around.  The kids are having fun with him too.  Tiffy probably plays the best with him.  She's into the whole "fetch" thing and Kozmo is too.  Josh is doing very well learning to care for him.  He tries to take Kozmo on walks, but Kozmo's not that good at following a leash yet.  Josh is doing a great job of taking him out and cleaning up after him.  After the third time with the neighbor dog, they really started playing: full blown chase.  Kozmo's really very mild tempered.  He doesn't run with abandon much like you'd expect a puppy to.  Maybe he's just not grown into it yet.  Seeing him play with the neighbor dog was fun.

I started work on a fence for the yard.  We're only allowed a split-rail fence by our Home Owner's Association.  The ground is so dry and hard it's like concrete.  We got all our post holes dug and some of the posts set.  I think we'll finish the fence Monday or Tuesday night.  It'll be good to have a fence up.  So far, Kozmo's keeping pretty tight, but I don't expect that to last for long.
