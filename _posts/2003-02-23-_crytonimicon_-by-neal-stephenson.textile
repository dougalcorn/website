I just finished reading <em>Cryptonomicon</em> by Neal Stephenson.  This may cast my geekiness in doubt, but I didn't really like the book.  First, it's huge.  Not that I have a problem with huge books; on the contrary.  All I'm saying is that choosing to read this book is a fairly large investment of time.  I don't think I got much of a time/value return on reading it.  Yes, Stephenson is like the geek's Tom Clancy.  That means he gives you much more detail than you ever really wanted to read.  I guess I know now what real military types think of Tom Clancy now.  Yes, there's lots of detail; but, it's either inane, an over simplification, or just silly.  Second, the plot is very complex.  There are at times three or four major plots.  It was over half of the book before I realized how these plots related.  It doesn't really all come together until the last quarter of the book.  In summary, it's a pretty good story he just takes too long to tell it.
