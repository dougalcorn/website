Boulder, CO has very good dining.  For lunch today, I ate at <a href="http://www.boulderinternetguide.com/BIGGOLD/Comments/sushi_tora.htm" target="_top">Sushi Tora</a>.  The locals here claims it's "as good as any shushi in America."  One of the guys I was working with claimed that's what the Japanese say when they visit here.  I also heard say that Sushi Tora made sushi for the Emporer of Japan when he visited the area.  It was very good.  The flavor was mild and not fishy; however, each different kind still kept a distinct taste.  It was all very tender and melted in your mouth.  Yummy!
