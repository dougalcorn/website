Google has updated it's satellite imagery for Cincinnati.  For the longest time it had totally awful imagery for Cinci.  I just found out tonight that it's been updated.  I can view "my neighborhood":http://maps.google.com/maps?&ll=39.352054,-84.250889&spn=0.007598,0.012822&t=k&hl=en at the highest resolution!

That's the Little Miami River just south of us.  The woods along the river make for very good hiking.  We're about a 5 to 10 minute walk to the river itself.  Just to the West of us is the local High School.  We can hear the band play at their Friday night football games.  If you scroll a little further South West, you can see "Paramount's Kings Island":http://perljam.net/google-satellite-maps/id/2625/United_States/Ohio/Cincinnati/Paramount_s_Kings_Island.
