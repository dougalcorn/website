I received my SanDisk Ultra II 1GB CompactFlash card.  Unsuprisingly, it got pretty much the same benchmark results as my 512MB card.  Also, the package clearly said I should expect about 10MB/sec read and 9MB/sec write speeds.  That's pretty much what I'm getting with my USB SanDisk ImageMate CF reader.
