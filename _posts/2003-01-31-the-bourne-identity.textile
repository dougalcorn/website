I watched <a href="http://imdb.com/Title?0258463" target="_top">"The Bourne Identity"</a> last night.  Since I'm in my hotel this week, I watched it on my laptop with headphones.  I enjoyed the movie.  I had never read the book and didn't have any preconcieved notions about the film from the book.  I was expecting an exciting spy thriller and that's what I got.  It was well directed and well acted.  I expecially enjoyed <a href="http://imdb.com/Name?Potente,%20Franka" target="_top">Franka Potente</a>.  She's a pretty big "star" in German films.  So, she brings a lot of exerience and good acting even though she's someone I'm not familiar with.  She also gives the film a very authentic European feel.  On the other hand, Julia Stiles, does a less than memorable role.  Her character's name is "Nicolette".  I assume that she's supposed to be French.  She just portrayed an American teenager with some fancy gear.  On the whole, the film was entertaining.  I'd watch it again.
