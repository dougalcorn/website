I'm taking a <a href="http://www.photographyandmore.com/Pages/Trips%20&#38;%20Seminars/Clifty%20Falls/Clifty%20Falls.htm" target="_top">hiking trip</a> to <a href="http://www.indianaoutfitters.com/clifty.html" target="_top">Clifty Falls</a> State Park in Indiana.  I'm really excited about this trip.  It's being put together by a guy in my local <a href="http://photo.meetup.com/9/" target="_top">Photography Meetup</a>.  He's a pro photography that has been contracted to do some photographs at Clifty Falls and he's invited us along for the run.  It should be a pretty challenging hike for me.  I haven't been very active lately and the trail Rick is taking is rated the hardest of the park.  In preparation, I've been doing time on the treadmill.  I don't want to be the slowest one of the bunch!
<p />
Also in preparation, I've ordered a photography backpack.  I have to admit that organizing stuff in backpacks is one of those little things I obsess over.  I have a hard time even walking past the backpacks in Wal-Mart without stopping to unzip the pockets to see how they're laid out.  So, it stands to reason I'd also obsess over what bag to use to carry my camera gear.  Here's my requirements: one camera body with lens, one Sigma 70-200mm/F2.8 (3 lbs. and a tad over 7"), possibly another lens or so, space to carry snacks and/or a meal, and space to carry enough water (I'm guessing I'll need about 2 liters for a six mile hike).  Oh, I also have a Gitzo Aluminum Explorer tripod (5 lbs. and 25" folded length) I need to figure out how to carry.
<p />
I had originally look at the <a href="http://www.tamrac.com/5749.htm" target="_top">Tamrac Velocity 9</a>.  I had heard several good reviews about this bag and how easy it is to carry and also access the camera.  The Velocity 9 is the largest of the series.  However, I've also heard that it's not so easy to access the other bits and pieces due to it'd toploader access.  I was worried there wouldn't be enough room for my extra stuff like food and water.  Also, there's no way to attach my Gitzo.  I'd have to buy the (extra) Gitzo strap and sling it over my shoulder in addition to the backpack.

I didn't want to spend the money for a full-blown photography backpack.  They can be quite expensive.  However, I think I found the perfect backpack for me: the <a href="http://www.lowepro.com/Products/Backpacks/allWeather/Mini_Trekker_AW.aspx" target="_top">Lowepro Mini Trekker AW</a>.  This has plenty of room for my camera gear plus extra space for other stuff like food, water, rain jacket, umbrella, reflectors, what have you.  However, it's not gigantic either.  It's only 12 x 12.5 x 16" ( W x D x H) and 3lbs.  Plus it has a quick-release tripod holder!  I tested it out at the camera store and my tripod won't extend much over the top of the bag as to interfere with hiking.  Obviously this Lowepro is more than the Tamrac.  However, I also don't have to buy the extra Gitzo strap.

I'm really excited about this bag.   I ordered it yesterday and I'm hoping to have it by the weekend.  My hike isn't until next weekend though so I'm sure it'll be here in time.  I hope I can use this backpack quite a bit this summer.
