Rob and Jennifer are a wonderful couple from church.  They live about 20 minutes away.  This has hampered our really getting to know them.  However, they have been there when we really needed them.  One night after Justin was born Carla was bleeding way too much.  I had to take her to the emergency room at about 2:00am.  Rob came to the house and stayed with Josh and Justin when Justin was about six or seven days old.  Both Rob and Jennifer have demonstrated a tremendous willingness to serve others.  Now that so many people who attended our church have moved away I think both Rob and I are looking around to see who's going to fill that vacuum.  I hope we can become closer friends with Rob and Jennifer.

To that end, we invited them over for dinner last night.  Rob is very funny and talks almost non-stop.  Jennifer, of course, is quiet and does her best to enjoy the ride.  We had a great time listening to stories of their son and daughter.  Matthew is a couple of years older than Josh.  Sometimes I think parenting is so unique to each kid it's nearly impossible to extract useful abstractions.  Other times it seems like every kid is just alike.  They all seem to know just the things to aggravate their parents and keep us just on (or off) the verge of a mental breakdown.
