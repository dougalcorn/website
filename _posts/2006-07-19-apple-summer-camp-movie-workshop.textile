Josh and I just got back from the "Apple Summer Camp: Movie Workshop":http://www.apple.com/retail/camp/movies.html.  It was pretty fun, but fast moving.  We were assigned a project to create a 30 second commercial for anything in the Apple store.  Earlier that morning the "camp counselors" had shot some raw footage for the Nike+iPod shoes.  Right after telling us our assignment, they went through importing and editing their video to produce a commercial.  They added music and a voice over and some transitions.  They then turned us loose to shoot our own video.

Josh decided to shoot a video for "Star Wars Battlefront":http://www.lucasarts.com/games/swbattlefront/index2.html.  We had 10 minutes to shoot the video and 30 minutes to edit and produce the commercial.  We ended up with a pretty good little "video":http://lathi.net/movies/star_wars_commercial.mov (2MB Quicktime).

I took my "Panasonic PV-GS180":http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/vModelDetail?modelNo=PV-GS180 DV camcorder and my Macbook Pro.  It's a good thing too because they didn't have enough cameras for everyone to use.  Their plan was to use the built in iSights on the various Macs.  Also, my Macbook Pro was pretty snappy for edits and such.  

All in all we had fun.  I'm going to try and get Josh to do another video today at home while it's still fresh in his mind.  We're both looking forward to tomorrow's "iWeb Workshop":http://www.apple.com/retail/camp/iweb.html.

*UPDATED:* We had about 30 minutes to kill before the camp started.  Josh and I created this three page comic using "Comic Life":http://plasq.com/comiclife called 
<a href="http://blog.lathi.net/files/Camping_Chaos.pdf">Camping Chaos</a> (3MB PDF) -- zero prior experience.  I actually think Josh had more fun with this than making the movie!
