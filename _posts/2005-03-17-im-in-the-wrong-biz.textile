The <a href="http://boingboing.net/" target="_top">Directory of Wonderful Things</a> points out a write-up of a tour of Pixar's facilities.  One of the cool things is the "groovy non-cubicles" there.  Cubicles are the bane of corporate existence.  Nobody likes them.  I honestly don't know why companies keep buying them.  I guess it's like all the other silly corporatisms: it makes financial sense to someone at some level.  Probably the guys who have really nice offices.

Walking through the animation department is like walking through a neighborhood for dwarves. Lots of little houses laid out along streets each one with an address on the door."

I guess I missed the time when developers could make decisions like this.  Try this out and see if it works: "A lot of the developers decided early on they didn't want 17" monitors, so instead Big Company found these groovy 30" Cinema Displays that they bought for them."
