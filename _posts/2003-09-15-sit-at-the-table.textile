Speaking of not-being-a-baby, Tiffany seems to be ready to leave her high-chair.  We have a booster seat for Justin so he sits up at the table.  We pull Tiffany's high-chair up to the table; but she's still not really up at the table.  She climbs up into Justin's seat all the time.  I know Carla's not ready for Tiffany to leave the high-chair.  I'm not sure if I am or not.  She certainly seems like she's wanting to sit in a booster seat at the table.  She's still a messy eater ;-).  
The other thing is that our table is sized for four people to sit around it.  Adding a fifth chair pretty much means we'll need to put the leaf in and leave it there.  That means there will be a little less room in the kitchen.  I guess sooner or later we'll have to do that anyway.  We're a family of five and take up more room than a family of four.
