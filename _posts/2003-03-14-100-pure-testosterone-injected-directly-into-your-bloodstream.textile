My budy invited me to go to the firing range with him.  He owns two handguns.  One is a Glock 9mm and the other is some expensive 0.40 caliber.  He said the Glock was about $500 and the other was about $800.  Honestly, I could tell the difference.  Of course, the Glock had less kick.  The other gun was a lot bigger caliber.  But the Globk was more "rough".  It was much harder to load.  Even though the clip held a nominal 10 rounds, I could only get nine in.  Even then it was pretty hard on my thumb.   Firing was rough too.  I could see that if I had to fire several hundred rounds, it would wear a blister and eventually a callous on my finger.  The other gun (whatever it's name is) was the opposite of all that.  It was easy to load, easy to fire.  Yes, it had more "kick"; but, boy did it shoot smooth.

I did OK.  Chris is a much better shot.  I got most of them on the targets at about 25 feet.  Towards the end I started over-compensating for the kick and my shots started dropping a little low.  Anyway, Chris said I did well and I feel like I did well.  On the other hand, it's not as if it really matters.  It will probably several more years before I shoot again.  But, it was fun.
