So we got up at about 7:00am.  All the kids were upstairs waiting
"patiently."  We had told them not to come down until 7:30am.  My
sister-in-law's house only has one bathroom and it's down stairs.  So,
kids were trickling one by one up and down the stairs before the
aloted hour.
<p />
Once we were all up and ready, we had the oldest kid, Tim, pass out
the presents.  All the kids had their own pile of goodies.  Here's the
age old question: How do you let the kids open their presents?  Is it
just a melee where kids and wrapping paper fly?  Do you take turns
opening one present at a time?  We ended up letting each kid take
turns opening all their presents.  This meant the oldest had to wait
for the youngest to open everything before they could start.  Thanks
to some very patient kids, this worked OK.
<p />
The only problem was that for some reason my 2-year old, Justin, woke
up grumpy.  He was pretty happy getting to open all of his presents.
The problem came when he was done and had to watch the other kids open
their presents.  Even with his frustrations the day was a success.  I
think everyone was happy with their gifts.
