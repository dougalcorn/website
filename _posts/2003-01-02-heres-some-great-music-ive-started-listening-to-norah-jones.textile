<a href="http://www.dminor.com/" target="_top">Dave Minor</a> told me he got Norah Jones' CD
for Christmas.  After a few minutes of questions, I'm downloading mp3s
from her <a href="http://www.norahjones.com" target="_top">site</a>.  She has a rich, sultry
voice.  It's hard for me to listen and work at the same time; I find
myself stoping to listen and feel.  In a way she reminds me of Bonny
Raitt without as much rock.  This may be the next CD I buy.
