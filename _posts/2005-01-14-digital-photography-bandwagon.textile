The Digital Photography Weblog is <a href="http://digitalphotography.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000903027396/" target="_top">reporting</a> and interesting statitic that Scott Kelby is the top-selling computer book author in the US of 2004.  His <em>Adobe Photoshop CS Book for Digital Photographers</em> "outsold all other computer books by more than 5 percent."  
<p />
I'm not sure what this means though.  At the least it means digital photography is a <em>very</em> hot topic.  I like to think of myself as someone that rarely "follows the crowd".  I don't want to believe I have a "group think" mentality, but here I am jumping into the hobby that spawns the number one computer book of 2004.
