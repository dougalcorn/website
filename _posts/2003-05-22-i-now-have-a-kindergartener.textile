Last night was Joshua's pre-school graduation.  They had a "procession" where each kid walked across the stage and shook their teacher's hand.  He got a diploma; his teachers put together a little book with pictures from each month of school.  After the whole deal, they had cake and ice cream.  On the way home Joshua asked me, "Am I a kindergartener now?"
