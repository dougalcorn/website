I've had 14 different addresses in my life.  Not counting various apartments at various times, my wife and I have owned four houses in the (almost) 11 years we've been married.  Based on all this moving, house buying, and house selling experience I can offer up this truism:  A house is never so lovely as it is just before you sell it.  In pursuit of this statement, Carla and I have made a long list of things we should have been doing all along but never found enough time, energy, or money to get done.

One of my jobs (that I finished on Monday) was caulking.  I'm really bad at it.  The art of caulking consists of two primary skills.  First, you must be able to put down an appropriate sized bead of steady thikness.  My beads are more like a series of big globby dots connected by a thin string of silicone.  Second, you must be able to take your finger (wet I'm told) and gently smooth out the bead leaving a nice clean line.  I always end up just wiping my bead off and having to redo the whole thing.  Ta da!  I found a new gadget at Lowe's.  It basically makes the finger skill unnecessary.  So this time I have lots of nice, clean, caulking seals!
