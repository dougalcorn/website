I think there were about 30 men from my church who attended.  Dr. Michael Westerfield came down from <a href="http://rc.edu/" target="_top">Rochester College</a> to be our speaker.  I found him warm, personable, and insightful.  He spoke from I Corinthians 12 - 14, but mainly focusing on 12.
<p />
He talked about talents and using them for the common good.  Also how/why we need to actively work at getting everyone to identify their talents and to respect everyone's talents.  He quoted:
<blockquote>
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. -- <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013%20;&#38;version=31;" target="_top">I Corinthians 13:13</a>
</blockquote>
<p />
He said, "I, personally, believe we live in a time when many of the things thought of as 'Spiritual Gifts' have passed away.  What we have left is faith, hope, and love.  In the Churches of Christ we have the faith and hope down pretty well.  We need to learn to love."
<p />
It was a great evening/morning that really focused me on serving God in the Church.  I hope I can maintain the commitment to serve.

I highly recommend these facilities.  It was only $45/night/person including two meals.  The cabins were modern and clean, yet woodsy.  There was a lot of attention to detail.  Even the traditional camp bath house was comfortable.  They don't have a website (or Google doesn't know about it), but their number is (859) 586-5475.
