I got behind on my blogging.  When I'm at home, it's actually hard to spend time blogging as things happen.  So, I was storing stuff up until I got to Cleveland.  I'm finding it's also hard to write about things in the past.  It's almost like redoing stuff.  If you know anything about me, it's that I hate redoing stuff.  I'll try to stay up to date.
