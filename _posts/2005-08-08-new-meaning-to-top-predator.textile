Thanks to "jwz":http://jwz.livejournal.com/520701.html, I saw this cool video of an "octopus taking out a shark":http://video.pbs.org:8080/ramgen/wnet/nature/octopus/sharkT1.rm.  I love octopi.  They are so smart!  There's lots of stories of them doing amazing things.  They have fairly long life-spans and can bond with humans as a pet.  Obviously, it's pretty hard to keep them.  Their ink is just as toxic to them as to their enemies.  If your octopus gets spooked, it's a 100% water change on your tank!  I'd love to have one, but I realize it's totally out of the question.  Anyway, it's fun to collect stories like this of octopuses outsmarting their captors.
