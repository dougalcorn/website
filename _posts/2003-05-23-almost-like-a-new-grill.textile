My friend, Dave, told me he just got a new grill early for Father's Day.  It reminded me I had bought the innards for my old crusty grill.  As noted just prior, I was sitting here aggrevated my program wasn't working right and figured a break would do me good.  So, I went out and fixed my grill.  It's frightening to think about all the rusty, greasy crud at the bottom of an old grill.  Now I have a mostly cleaned out hull of a grill with bright shiny gas pipes and clean lava rocks.  Here's to cook'n out!
