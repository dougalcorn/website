Carla's out doing some "last minute" Christmas shopping.  I'm at home pulling "Dad duty".  We has Josh write his letter to Santa before Carla left.  It was "Spiderman this" and "Spiderman that".  Basically, every cool toy he could think of, he wanted the <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><font color="#0000FF">SpiderMan</font></span><a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/edit/Main/SpiderMan?topicparent=Main.WebHome">?</a> version of it.  He also wants a <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><font color="#0000FF">SonyPlayStation2</font></span><a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/edit/Main/SonyPlayStation2?topicparent=Main.WebHome">?</a>; however, I don't have the $200 - $300 necessary to buy one and all the gizmos that go with it (extra memory, extra controller, and of course the Spiderman game).
