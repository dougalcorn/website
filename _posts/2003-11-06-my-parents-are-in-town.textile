My mom and dad came up yesterday to spend just about a week with us.  Joshua's sixth birthday is this weekend.  The kids were very excited to see them.  Of course, I was still "in flight" when they got here.  This morning was nice to go down and have coffee while they were eating breakfast.  I just don't get to see my parents enough.  I enjoy having them around as much as the kids do. <img alt="smile" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/smile.gif" />
