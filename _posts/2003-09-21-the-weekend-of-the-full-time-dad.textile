Carla drove up to Chicago this weekend for a scrapbooking convention.  One of her long-time friends flew up from OKC to spend the weekend with her.  She just got back tonight.  It sounds like she had a really great time.
<p />
The point of this blog post is that I had the kids all weekend while she was gone.  I took a vacation day on Friday so she could leave early in the morning.  So, I had the kids all day Friday and Saturday and almost all of Sunday.   All in all I survived.  The house isn't too much more of a mess then when I got home.  I pretty much counted on not getting anything done and that's pretty much what I got done (although I did manage to install a new <a href="http://www.lathi.net/cgi-bin/ids/index.cgi" target="_top">photo album</a> on the site; still no photos uploaded though).
<p />
Most of the time was spent playing outside and playing on the <a href="http://lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/GameCube">GameCube</a>.  I told Carla tonight that I think I may actually have my fill of Nintendo for a while.  Neither one of us thought that was possible so quickly.  I'll admit that I took the easy way out.  I should have taken the kids out and done lots of fun things with them.  It's just so intimidating to take the kids out by myself.  Josh asked me why we weren't going out for lunch today after church.  I told him it was just too much work.  I'm very self-conscious about how the kids behave in public.
<p />
I don't want this to sound too much like a pitty party.  I did enjoy my time with the kids.  They are very cute.  This age (5, 2, and 1) is a great time.  They have very little guile right now.  Of course, it doesn't take much to get them really wound up.  Conversely, it takes quite a bit to get them settled back down.  Ah, but they're kids.  You hate to sit on them too much.  Yes, when they run like hoolagins around the house laughing a screaming it gets pretty annoying.  (For better or worse, I did this weekend with no coffee.  So, I pretty much had a headache all weekend.)  But, they are having such fun.  They're kids.  They should have fun.  I shouldn't always let my convenience trump their fun.  Often I do.  Sometimes I don't.

They were very excited to see their mother when Carla got home.  Even Princess (our dog) was excited.  Of course, I was excited.  Carla was excited too... for about an hour.  She was home just in time to put the kids to bed <img alt="big grin" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/biggrin.gif" /> .  After that we caught up together on the weekend from both sides.  Pretty quick she was ready to head up to bed.  A couple of old girlfriends with no kids... she says she didn't get much sleep.  Funny, I told her she could have stayed home and not gotten much sleep.  Don't know why she didn't laugh. <img alt="wink" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/wink.gif" />
