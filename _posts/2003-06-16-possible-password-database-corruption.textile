title: Possible Password Database Corruption?

I tried to log into our intranet's web site using http auth this morning.  For some reason, the password I had in my "database" wouldn't work.  I was browsing the site through a secure shell tunnel (redirecting port 8080 on my local machine through a ssh session to port 80 on the other side).  I thought maybe that was the problem.  So, I opened a ssh session on the host of our intranet and used w3m to browse the site locally.  My password was still bad.  Luckily, I had authorization to update the .htpasswd file on the intranet site.  So I just reset my password to what I thought it should be.  I'm a little troubled by this since I don't know the cause for it.  I certainly hope my password database isn't corrupt.  I thought I'd just make a note of this and move on.  If it happens again, I'll have a record of this incident.
