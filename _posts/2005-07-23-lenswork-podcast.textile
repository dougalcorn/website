I'd like to recommend the "podcast":http://lenswork.com/lwpc.htm at "Lenswork.com":http://lenswork.com.  While many podcast are 25, 30, sometimes 45 minutes long; lenswork is usually 3 or 4 minutes.  These are little nuggets of insight from a guy who's been involved with photography for long time.  He "gets" digital photography, but still has strong ties to film.  The podcasts are focused on getting you to think about photography and art and what it all means.  For less than 5 minutes of audio every few days, it's highly worth it.
