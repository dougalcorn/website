While I'm blogging family stuff, I'll share a funny story.  This is convincing evidence of genetic gender programming.

I came upstairs the other day to find my four year old daughter, Tiffany, and my five year old son, Justin, in what seemed to be a knock-down, drag-out fight.  While no actual blows had been thrown, tempers were pretty high.  "No! You do it!" "I'm not going to do it! You do it!"

Turns out Justin had lifted the toilet seat and was refusing to put it back down.  Tiffy had to go potty, but was also refusing to put the seat down.  For the record, I sided with Tiffy and made Justin put the seat back down.
