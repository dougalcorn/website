I watched "30 Days: Minimum Wage":http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/30days/main.html tonight.  That's the best reality show I've seen on TV.  Totally unscripted.  Real people living real lives dealing with a real problem.  

The premise of the whole series is to spend 30 days doing something you don't normally do.  In this episode, the show's creator and his fiance live for 30 days on minimum wage.  It really opened my eyes and my heart went out to them and other "working poor".

If you get a chance, you should watch this show.  Probably one of the better shows I've seen in a long time.
