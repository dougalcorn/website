So, <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2005/03/20/were_the_hub_of_the_universe_but_cincinnati_is_eating_our_lunch/?rss_id=Boston%20Globe%20--%20Business%20News" target="_top">Cincinnati is a livable city</a>.  The business section of <a href="http://boston.com" target="_top">http://boston.com</a> has a write-up on how much big business is moving from the Boston area to Cincinnati.  Here's the hinge-pin:
<p />
<blockquote>Today, however, Cincinnati is shaking off its image as a stodgy, out-of-step backwater, and gaining buzz for what residents say has long been true: it's an affordable, livable city.</blockquote>
<p />
What a glowing endorsement! <img alt="wink" src="http://www.lathi.net/twiki/TWiki/SmiliesPlugin/wink.gif" />  "Affordable" and "livable" instead of "stodgy".  Well, Cincinnati is affordable and livable.  I guess if your perspective is from "The Center of the Universe" calling Cincinnati "livable" may be the best you can do.
