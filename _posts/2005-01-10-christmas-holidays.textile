The snow started the Wednesday before Christmas.  Carla went out playing with the kids the first day it snowed and <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2004/12-December/Snow%20Day/">took some pictures</a>.  Unfortunately, I had to work that day.  The snow was bad enough for the Kroger building closed early at 2:00pm that day.  I still didn't get home until almost 7:00pm that night.  We got a lot more snow that night and I didn't go into work on Thursday.  That means I got to go <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2004/12-December/Snow%20Day%202/">sledding with the boys</a> too.  The next day (Friday, Christmas Eve) we drove up to Wisconsin to spend the holidays with my in-laws.  The drive was OK minus about two hours of horrible driving on I-74 in Indiana.

While in Wisconsin we (of course) <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2004/12-December/Wisconsin/Christmas%20Presents/">opened some presents</a> and then <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2004/12-December/Wisconsin/More%20Christmas%20Presents/">opened some more presents</a>.  We also did some more <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2004/12-December/Wisconsin/Sledding/">sledding</a> although the snow wasn't as deep as it was back in Cincinnati.  
<p />
I went hiking <a href="http://home.lathi.net/gallery/2004/12-December/Wisconsin/By%20The%20Creek/">by the creek</a> in Bangor with my nephew, Tim.  I was pretty excited about those photos, but in retrospect they didn't turn out as nicely as I'd like.  I think they were overall too dark.  I can go through the post processing of the digital images again to brighten them, but don't really want to spend the time.
